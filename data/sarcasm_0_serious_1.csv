0,&gt; I still don't understand why anyone votes labour these days, after Blair and Brown.  There are people up north that will always vote Labour, because their family historically has. It's a great system when people vote against their interests because of generational pressure.

0,No, Conley and TA didn't play at all, and Gasol was playing with a sprain from the Clippers game, so when it got out of hand he sat down.     What no one wants to talk about is how the back end of our bench absolutely crushed it. Russ Smith and Jordan Adams are clearly better than the Splash brothers. Secret Weapons. 
0,You're not picking a QB, who cares? 
0,Because you speeding does not directly result in a crash statistically.  Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.  The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving ""too fast for conditions"", and another 4.9% were ""too fast for curve"". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).    Now one could say, ""Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.""  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments!

The oil industry/Koch bros want to kill anything the gov't does toward that end to minimize the public's knowledge of the truth and the possible use of any evidence to back anti-green house gas regulations (say, by the EPA which has been in their crosshairs for years).  Remember, the Koch bros. are funding the GOP election to the tune of nearly a BILLION dollars.  But hey, the parties are the same.  So, stay home.  Don't vote.

But I guess they aren't ""sacred"" enough.

MSL has also really stepped up to the plate and consistently makes spectacular plays that help push the team to success. We should all blame Boyle, right?

0,&gt;A webpage set up for the event - which called for ""zero tolerance policies on all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression"" - initially stated that the meeting was ""for all self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include 'woman.'""  First of all WTF is ""self-defining black""?  Can I be transracial?  Isn't that *cultural appropriation*.  Second of all, does ""gender identities that include 'woman.'"" mean that *trans-men* (born a woman; identify as a man) are also banned?  I can agree with ""zero tolerance policies on all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression"".  Goldsmiths should start by expelling Bahar Mustafa for her blatent bigotry.  Edit:  The article never clarified the gender of the organizer, and ""Bahar"" just sounded like a male name.  I am more embarrassed by not noticing the blatant hypocrisy of a man organizing a women-only event had I been correct in my original interpretation.  I have corrected my pronoun.  Thanks /u/BIG_GUY_FOR_YOU for calling me out on my blatant bigotry...

0,considering how the rules have been changing, we shouldn't waste any draft picks on such a player, but rather just recruit some struggling MMA guys so that its less of a penalty when they get suspended for hitting a WR, and if one of them is a good kick boxer, maybe we can have him properly train AB during his suspension periods.

0,No rape is when you have sex with someone without their consent. If someone can't consent or can't consent properly then I think it's wrong.   If you're drunk and someone takes advantage of your inebriation then that's rape, I'd say. I mean, unless that's what a fun night on the town is for some people. I wouldn't want to get in the way of that.

Sure, it can be fun, but not only are people being more negative, the player base is shrinking by the day. But oh nooooo...DAYZ is far above the pitfalls of WarZ.

0,I believe they are just slowly getting around to giving everything higher repair bills. Repair bill balance will make no sense for a couple months imo.  People keep mentioning how they have no problem at all making millions without even trying so Gaijin have decided to do something about it. 
0,That's EXACTLY what I'm interested in. 
0,if they showed you more it would be spoilers. ciri's sequences are linear and closed off from the main game. like a playable flashback to relate ciri's story to the going ons of the witcher world.  but sure, 2 minutes of isolated gameplay is totally enough to reach your conclusion 
0,I bought two of each, Seagate and WD, for a 4-drive FreeNAS box...I just wanted the chance to bitch about both...even though its probably not likely that I'll have all of them fail anytime soon...its approach reserves my place in the queue to harp/bitch/moan/hate/etc. on either or both companies. 
0,Je weiter ich runterscrolle, umso lauter wird das ""Vergesst es!""-Echo in meinem Schädel.  Man sollte vielleicht doch an irgendeiner Stelle die Staatsquote ins Spiel bringen, da sie ersichtlich macht, wieviel Ressourcen die jeweilige Regierung tatsächlich zur Verfügung hat. Rumänien beispielsweise hat gemessen am BIP mit 35,1% die niedrigsten Staatsausgaben in der Union¹; bei einer Verachtfachung der Flüchtlingsmenge dürfte das System dort doch recht schnell an seine Grenzen kommen².  Und man kann sich darüber beschweren, dass sie nicht genügend tun, aber Ländern wie Spanien, Portugal und Irland, die die Krise noch nicht richtig überwunden haben, jetzt zehntausende Flüchtlinge zu überreichen könnte nicht die beste Idee sein. Und bei dem Wahlkampf, der in Großbritannien geführt wird, ist jede Lösung, in der dort mehr Menschen aufgenommen werden müssen, zum Scheitern verurteilt, das unterschreibt weder Cameron noch Miliband.  ¹ Zugegeben: Das wird vermutlich auch daran liegen, dass hier das eine oder andere aus EU-Strukturfonds finanziert wird, außerdem: http://de.statista.comtatistik/datentudie/6769/umfragetaatsquoten-der-eu-laender/  ² Wäre außerdem mal ein echter Anreiz zum Sparen!

If this is remotely true, iit's probably because he picked a fight with her and then got snapped at. In other AWALT news, all 3 generations of women in my family went to watch the Russian ballet and gazed admiringly at the be-tighted male dancers for 2 solid hours. Did we go home and compare our non-dancer SO's to them unfavourably? YOU BETCHA

Most of the league keeps with the policy of 'drafting stupid', resulting in an ever-changing ranking of the teams. Patriots, just 'draft for value' every time, ruining this league-wide cohesive behaviour, threatening the very base of the NFL and its office. We can't allow that. We've had two 1st-over-all QB-picks and keep on getting clobbered by a 6th rounder and a guy in a hoodie. That shouldn't happen, ever. I should be possible without cheating.""  PS: all that was

Trae Waynes is the best cover corner in the draft, he's quick, lanky, and plays almost exclusively on the x/z receiver. Of course he's going to be bad in the run game, because he's basically never been expected to set an edge or mind a gap, and he won't be doing that with the Vikings, either, so idk what the fuck everyone is ragging on him for.  It's like calling a draft prospect ""inexperienced"". Well, no shit. They're not seasoned veterans? Could've fooled me.

It strongly concludes that ""force feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds."" @ http://ec.europa.eu/food/fsccah/out17_en.pdf  Well, you're from the US after all.

0,If one watched that split, Vulcun also placed third, and were beaten by TSM 2-1 in the semi's, which GGU subsequently lost to in the finals 3-2.Vulcun didn't get the luxury of a B of 5 like GGU, and their series against TSM was also fairly close, much like GGU's. Arguably the 2 teams (Coast and Vulcun) could have been = in strength. Back then I was actually of the opinion that Vulcun was better than GGU, they just had to face TSM earlier than GGU did in the bracket... I don't even remember who GGU faced in semi's, but it wasn't nearly as bad as TSM, plus, Vulcun beat Curse just to get to the semis I think.  -edit Ok looking back, it's weird. Vulcun beats CLG, then beats Curse, then faces TSM in semi's... But Despite losing, Curse also plays GGU in the semis. WTF is this bracket??? GGU beats Dignitas, then beats Curse in Semi's and then faces TSM in the finals. Pretty similar paths, Vulcun had to play an extra set earlier for... reasons? wins 2 sets, then loses in a close set to TSM. GGU beats two teams in a a best of 3 then loses to TSM. Who was better? Too bad they never got a chance to play each other in the bracket, my money was on Vulcun easy. Jintae/Dude couldn't handle Mancloud/Xmithie, guarantee it.  Coast also got relegated the split right after Vulcun did, at least Vulcun could say they got relegated by LMQ... Coast got relegated by Complexity! They requalified through the expansion tournament in a reverse sweep upset over Fusion that shouldn't have been possible without the legendary Maknoon tilt. Worst competitive Rumble games I've ever seen.  Tl;Dr... Bring it on Coast Fanboys, your team is/was a bigger shitter than mine!

0,Are you talking about this?  &gt;The early 2000s recession was a decline in economic activity which mainly occurred in developed countries. The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States in 2002 and 2003. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation.[citation needed] Japan's 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) had already ceased in East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession wasn't as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_2000s_recession  It takes a real prophet to forecast economic cycles.

0,&gt; I don't believe for one second that Biz was not showing effort. That dude Breeds effort. He constantly is getting as cut as possible and is always training and always gets backed by teammates as a hard worker.  How many Hornets practices have you watched?  How many scrimmages?  How much tape?  How much have you talked to the trainers?  I'm gonna go ahead and say less than Clifford.    &gt; Being top 10 in defense doesn't mean he doesn't plays undersized line ups that lost us 4th Q leads....  I remember line ups of Kemba/Roberts/PJ/Marv/maxiell every single person is undersized in that group.  Bottom line he subbed defense for offense in the 4th and that resulted in losses.  You have to deal the cards you're dealt.  We don't have a very tall team, so we're going to be playing undersized ball a lot.  I don't think the lineup you mentioned really saw that much floor time.  PJ didn't play very often.  When we did put that lineup (or variations of that lineup) on the court, it was to score points.  The team is much, much better at defense than offense.  More often than not the reasons why we lost games were due to offensive problems rather than defensive problems.  Roberts, PJ, and Marvin are all better from 3 than the other guys at their positions (or at least were before Mo came).  They're still not good, but they're the best option to put points on the board.    &gt; Cliff foolishly stuck with his guns ... while our young players matured and needed more touches which they didn't get this year  1. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Clifford had no reason to go into the season with the assumption that Al would regress so much.  Had Al been healthy, the plan would have worked and we'd be in the playoffs.    2. Our team is built around Big Al on both offense and defense.  Our entire defensive strategy comes from a scheme Clifford devised to hide Al's weaknesses by focusing on team help D.  The players we signed were meant to compliment big Al (PJ, Marvin, Roberts, Mo, Lance, etc) and fit the system.    3. You can't easily change your identity mid- or late-season.  Players need time to learn new roles, new gameplans, and new schemes.  Making a radically new system is not something you can introduce overnight.  A lot of time, money, and talent is invested into the Big Al system (which has proven to be successful before).  When a tire goes flat on your car, the car naturally won't work as well as before.  That doesn't mean that you need to buy a new car, only get new tires.  We've had a lot of flats this year.  4. Which young players?  MKG got more playing time and lots more touches and shots on offense than ever before.  Zeller got loads more playing time and even became the regular starter.  I'm not sure you can honestly use PJ and ""matured"" yet in the same sentence.    &gt; He actually threw MKG under the bus very hard recently and it pissed me off.    ???? Clifford said [MKG might be Hornets most important player.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnelltatus/588732257600458752)  ""[He has a contagious competitiveness about him....When he wasn't on the floor I didn't like it](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnelltatus/588733044938375168).""  [Clifford said the simplest measure of MKG's value is when he didn't play they didn't win.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnelltatus/588733213343932418)  Yeah, Clifford *really* hates MKG.

0,No, no, you see, it doesn't work that way.  See: when a man holds open a door for a (hot) woman, she has to have sex with him (regardless of whether or not she finds him attractive or even *wants* to have sex with him). However, women don't get to have sex with hot men they hold doors open for, because those men are just shitty douchebros who only use women for sex, as opposed to the sweet, caring Nice Guys, who only *want* women for sex.  I hope this has been an educational experience for you, female (and you *have* to be female, because you're attracted to men and that's *the only possibility*). Now, get back in the kitchen!

They're essentially test tube babies, except instead of using eggs and sperm, they used light and celestial dust.  There's no blood, no tissue, no hair.  They aren't related in the same sense that human siblings are.  &gt;but I never cared about them being related. Hera is Zeus' sister for fuck's sake, and they DO share DNA.  No, they don't.  It's explained in the books that the gods *don't* have DNA in the same sense as us, which is why cosmic incest is all fine and dandy, and why the kids aren't biologically related  &gt;And yeah, no queer man has ever lied about their orientation. Ever. Especially not ones raised by a macho dick.  I didn't realize gay men became visibly uncomfortable in the presence of other gay men.

It would be quicker and easier to list the ones that didnt.   So in reality native americans appropriated mayan, celtic, roman, greek and scandinavian culture. Fucking shitlords

0,He compares it to DotA. I can't even imagine what starcraft and warcraft would have been like with pay walls for custom games. If a mod gets extremely popular because of how well its done and how extensive it is, then that person can probably get a job based on gaming.   If a modder wants to charge for what they make, then they are solely responsible for ensuring it works, meets the quality of the description they give, and will provide support to players who encounter problems that are unexpected. I'm sure modding can be considered a hobby at the point and worth the money. 
0,Oh, definitely! In this case though, I doubt so. I mean why would a man who ""doesn't laugh at jokes"", who is ""smarter and have common sense"" want to be seen as an insane, emotional character? He's way too smart and logical for that!!!

0,WIS isn't any more powerful than CHA. You should have no problem there. INT is the only mental stat that's noticeably more powerful than the rest.  Some may argue that since CHA and WIS apply to a similar number of skills but WIS also applies to Will saves, that makes it better. I refer those people to the feat found in totally-fair-and-not-broken-ACG which gives the Oracle Divine Grace, as the Paladin ability (add CHA to all saves in addition to their base stat), so lack of this option actually makes WIS *weaker* than CHA for the Oracle's purposes.  Another option is to play a Lore Shaman instead of a Lore Oracle. Aside from being WIS based out the gate, Lore Shaman gets a very good reason to grab a non-trivial INT score as well which feels appropriate here. You also get a better spell list (arguably the BEST spell list in the game), a whole second Mystery that you can swap out every day, and a familiar. It's OK though, guys! It's PFS legal so that means its balanced!

0,Honestly, unless they're posting around 10 photos a day, who cares?  You can just scroll over them.  Your kid is tremendously special to you and if you want people to see that then that's natural.    If you're concerned about it being embarrassing for the kid, well have you considered that they're kids?  Kids do stupid shit all the time.  It's part of the growing up process.  Nothing will hurt if you post something embarrassing or cute.  Tastefully embarrassing of course.  I honestly just can't see what's so wrong about it.  I understand if it's disgusting pictures but that doesn't usually happen.    Shame on them for sharing something that makes them happy. 
0,Conservative-headlines? Seems like a fair unbiased news source. 
0,&gt; Sanders' is just saying what he thinks far left radicalists (which is his base) want to hear.  Yea, it's not like he has a 30 year record of voting for the things he believes in.

You're **another** entitled child, pretending that getting a degree somehow entitles you to a job that meets the criteria you've arbitrarily decided you deserve.   I'm really thankful people like you exist, because it makes the opportunities that are there for people who are willing to work more available.  So thanks!   PS:  If you were running a company, I bet you'd be clamoring to hire people with 0 experience, wouldn't you?

This is the crux of my issue with you. I hold some radical positions, I admit they are radical. That GG is moderate is a radical position, one that locates you far from the main stream. The New York Times is mainstream. All the ""slanderous"" articles written about GG are mainstream. Bruit art is not mainstream, they are not even mainstream right. (This is a general argument about GG not about you)  4. That Mill liberal thing means jack crap to anyone. It took me a week to figure out what you meant. And unlike most people I have a degree in philosophy (which I don't bring up because that was awhile ago). Also try John Rawls, you know us Yanks have something to contribute. :)  Jesus Christ you link me a book that I own as a citation. Please cite the relavent part.

Plenty of character designers have done works for other things like magazine promos or eroge, that doesn't make them anime related. It's not like cosplay at all, cosplay is when someone is dressed up as a character. If he drew tohou characters cosplaying as anime characters, or anime characters cosplaying as touhou characters then sure, but that's not what this is. Oh, they have the ""same face""? Great, lets see how many character designers have worked on hentai or eroge and post that because ""they have the same face""

0,Formally, no. That doesn't occur until the writ of election has been filed with the governor general, usually 4 to 5 weeks ahead of the election. Now that Canada has fixed election terms and we know formulaically that the next election will have to be held on October 19,  2015, the writ will need to be drawn up for September 21, 2015 at the latest. When the writ drops then all formal campaign finance and advertising rules kick in.  However, functionally, we've been in election mode since the last election. This government basically only exists to campaign and justify its own existence and we're going to see that ramping up as the spring and summer progresses. Heck, we've already seen (and continue to see) them (mis)use taxpayer dollars to promote themselves under the guise of budget advertising.  Besides that the other parties will likely start to advertise during the summer to get in what they can before the formal advertising and finance rules kick in.  It's going to be a fun summer!

0,Faggot used to mean a bundle of sticks, definitions change with the masses. It's akin to the definition of communism.  Theorists would identify the communist revolutions we've had, and argue that these were simply despots using rhetoric to forment peasant revolutions in their interests.  The masses are told this is communism, and the rhetoric (the Communist party of China, Communist Party of Cuba, etc) also plays along with that.  So I can either assign the theorists opinions I hear often from left anarchists, that all of these incarnations of so called communism aren't communism, or I can use the definition most people, the masses, the working class, would agree with.  I find you use of language to be elitist and problematic. In Cambodia's Genocide by the Khmer Rouge, we're these people led by French Communist Educated Communists? Or Despots?  So again you can espouse completely rigid definitions for words and  concepts, but reality, history, and rhetoric used by groups in the past and in today, would disagree with that assertions.  &gt; Socialism isn't an identity  Are you sure?

While it has become more prevalent over time, it has been in practice since beta, and there isn't any solution for it other than to know it is happening as a player and be clever about it.    * Another common practice is to encourage a strategy or tactic that is, to a seasoned vet, obviously bad so that their friends on TS who are already dug in at that position, or are waiting in ambush, can farm away.

0,But they released Oblivion before Fallout! 
0,Yeah, cause going to the Jets totally puts him in a better situation than going to the Browns. 
0,It was supposed to be a touch of sarcasm honestly. The community is trying to make these individuals out to be martyrs, people that did nothing but assist the community.   They walked old ladies across the road and paid for the community block party out of their own pocket all the time. The police are lying about their criminal past to make them out to be bad people...

0,But... but... haven't they heard that according to developers us gamers don't care about single player or story anymore?  All we want is multiplayer, I mean just look at how huge of a success Titanfall was! 
0,This is an interesting take. The Nightwing costume is his New52 one in blue, and Robin is like 12 in pixie shoes and short shorts. Everybody knows that Dick was 16 minimum when he became Robin, always had pants and a suit he cobbled together in the Batcave.

0,&gt; By making the positive action an inherently masculine one, you're discounting femininity. &gt; It's much simpler to make it gender neutral &amp; then it doesn't reinforce shitty gender based generalizations.  Yeah I know right. Everytime I call someone a bitch, a dog somewhere cries.  Save dogs from sadness, don't call people bitches.  Are you also against calling people dicks? Everytime I hear that I feel so bad about my penis

Men are generally react most favorably to a similarly aged type of women (early 20s), regardless of their own age. Women tend to go sideways or up.  &gt; And aren't young women the target of TRP anyways?   14 year olds?!  &gt; look at all the ""Twi-moms"" who were attracted to the ""pretty boys"" in the Twilight movies.   Sure, Edward and Jacob totally look girlish

0,&gt; You want to know what I honestly think? There actually aren't many racists at all on here. I just see a lot of frustrated people because they're saying look... we're concerned about this issue - but every time they open their mouth they get called racist.  That must be why so many people simultaneously post suggestions of increasing educational availability along with their ""innocently posting"" ""just the facts"" about the areas in question.

0,to the down voters: sorry guys you all blew this. You may not like it what is said but this is on topic and very informed. This is an angle the OP should take into consideration.  But the other side is true as well. But don't fucking down vote when you disagree. It is so shallow.   And then: down voting someone to fucking -140? Geez, just take the guy out the back and shoot him already for daring to speak his mind. Someone like that clearly may not have his own opinion

0,It's because the time of philosophy has passed. Now it's time for science. I myself have read a few pages of Nietzsche and can refute that schizophrenic theist (How can you even kill God? lmao) in under 200 words. I don't need a degree to understand most branches of philosophy. I need a couple of hours a day in my bed with a book and a brain, not paying outrageous sums to people who wasted ten years of their life studying what amounts to astrology.

0,What? Conservatives with too-extreme anti-homosexual stances for no real discernible reason are actually overcompensating in hiding the fact that they themselves are homosexual due to feelings of shame and guilt propagated by their bible thumping circles of peers?  Well that just sounds crazy.

0,haha this always gets me. Turkey, as a state is simply not structured to have ""proxies"" in Syria. It just doesn't work. We have the same problem as Western countries in this sense.  Sure, Turkey's economy is large, but the rebels don't want to trade, they want Turkey to deposit cash into their accounts. Turkey is a democratic state, it can't just do that, the Saudi's can. That's not state oil revenue, it's taxpayer money. Turkey has a big military, but it can't just give the US the finger and transfer American weaponry to whoever it wants, like the Arab states are doing with Russian/Chinese equipment.   When it's all said and done, Turkey doesn't have the capacity to order the rebels around. The options for influencing the rebels are pretty slim, minus drastic actions (closing borders, military strikes). We can escalate and deliver supplies but, not control what happens afterwards.  edit: ""but Turkey bad! Turkey jihadist!""

0,Doesn't make too much sense as none of the three are facing capital punishment. The US isn't charging Assange with anything, Manning has already been sentenced and the death penalty isn't an option under the current charges against Snowden (even if additional charges are filed, the USG has committed not to seek capital punishment). The all-white spooky eyes and flames on the suit jacket are a nice touch though. Subtle.

What about all those after-school programs that many churches and famous people set up/donate to in Black communities? These were set up to lower the violence, to give bored children something to do, instead of hanging out in the streets.  But no, apparently that is not working on black on black crimes. Obviously many Black leaders ignore such things...yup

He sucks at making progressions (for now) and he doesn't have the accuracy.   &gt;That may change, but there wasn't a single QB in this draft (save Winston /maybe/) who is nfl ready.   I agree. I'm a Baylor fan too and I think he has potential but he's not ready yet.  But probably he'll surprise us all and be the GOAT.

They even hand cuffed her without throwing her to the ground, etc.  In many instances that I know many of you all have seen, the guy would have been jumped on, while hand cuffed, after being blown to pieces..... Why?  Because he's resisting... and if he's a American Black (not African-American) they would have to say, ""I was afraid for my life.""

0,The problem is how often and how easily they are spammed. A failed Max crash should fuck an entire base over. Your resources should be depleted and your ability to defend should go out the window. The resource system is not finished, and this leads to them being spammed far more than they should be. You are out of your mind if you can't see that they need some tweaks. Maxes have been one of the most broken things about this game since its inception. Res nades reviving them? ZOE? Fractures? Early Scat maxes? 100 resources to pull? Even back in the day when they were a class you could play all the fucking time? Yea dude, maxes have been super balanced!

And I was like, ""Uh could it be the extra 280 lbs you're carrying around?"". But no, it's never the weight that's the problem, the weight is a result of the problems

0,'Soul-crushing'? I suppose that depends on what their vocation is. Some farmers have it rough, regardless of where you go. China, Japan, Italy, America, etc. Running a resort in Rusutsu isn't really comparable to being a faceless salaryman on the Tokyo city transit, if that's any indication. A lot of city jobs aren't that 'soul-crushing' either. It depends on the city, and what part of that city. I'm sure you can imagine running a tea shop in a mall isn't nearly as stressful.    And I don't think Chevy is popular in Japan, so you probably won't find many suburbans.

0,You are right.   Using that same logic we should also outlaw motorcycles. It's just basic safety.   They account for &lt;1% of vehicular traffic and 10% of road traffic fatalities.   This places an undue burden on emergency services, hospitals and healthcare professionals.   Who cares if they are fun, people who think they should still be able to ride motorcycles are just crying about the ""Nanny state.""

0,not once did i use the word requirement or any version of it. and when i used the word obligated i meant it for bush's camp and christie.  the article points out that bush's camp, whos done a great amount of damage to the country, handpicked him to be the AG of jersey then he became governor with little to no resistance... putin could have beat corzine.  i hope more lobbyists become governors

Every time I shoot up heroin I feel euphoric so therefore I must be healthy (regardless of the bleeding, infected sores all over my body and the plethora of STD's I could be carrying).

Why should Warren Buffet pay any mind to a homeless black woman struggling with psychosis when he's got his hands full organizing a merger that will put billions in his pockets and cut another 2,000 jobs? Can't blame the rich. After all, it's only a matter of time before that wealth *has* to trickle down, right? 
0,Oh look, a group of black people street fighting over stupid shit everyone else doesn't pay any mind to... how fresh.

0,&gt; One other thing I get really frustrated by you guys acting as if you are against white supremacists when you are so racist against Asians. It is a complete double standard.  How so? The only anti-Asian racism on r/hapas I have seen are from white sexpat types trolling (or being srs, hard to tell) I have not seen racist Hapas.  &gt; If you guys are so against racism as you claim then why do I see misogynistic posts of Asian women, and the misery of being""half Asian"".  You mean ""being Asian in America"" because that's the real cause of our misery.  &gt; That is why I really ranted on Eurasian Tiger because he represents my worst nightmare of what I could become in the future. If my half brother is as deluded as him then it goes with out saying if I had a period of depression I could become as crazy as him if I am not careful.   Am I reading this to say that you've experienced similar issues to many of us?  &gt; Really the thing that frustrates me is that I once had those feelings. Feelings that I never belonged anymore and I only isolated myself more and more.  Then you sort of understand why r/hapas was created (not by me by the way).  &gt; because I felt isolated in Texas. I felt as though I was a perpetual foreigner.  &gt; I've been there and middle school is still by far the shittest period of my life.   Wow. Racism is real? Get outta here; mustabin your personality.

0,I found the paradoxes much more apparent and compelling than the people I watched the movie with did.  They thought one of the main themes of the movie was that Love literally transcended space and time, which is obviously false and not what Interstellar was about.    The movie is a paradox within a paradox - Cooper fulfills the inner paradox when he sends the messages while in the tesseract, and future humans fulfill the outer paradox in some distant time when they have the technology to ""send back"" the black hole and wormhole and create the tesseract.  Future humans would have known it was something they needed to do because it already happened, in the same way Cooper did.  Of course, you either think this kind of paradox is possible or you think it's impossible (hence it being a paradox).  Either way, I think it's very interesting.    IMO, people who think the point of the movie is that *Love* transcends time and space are really missing a **huge** part of it.  Sure, Love is a theme, and I think it was used to great emotional affect at the end.  If you didn't tear up a little bit when Cooper met old Murph... you're a heartless bastard!!

0,&gt;Homosexual behavior was not socially acceptable with the Vikings, Goths or Germans in ancient days  &gt;laying with another man could get your head removed.  &gt;To condone homosexual marriage is to condone the end of a family's line.   &gt;From my own observations of modern homosexual behavior I think it is a sickness that plagues a person's mind and a detriment to society. The duty of a man to his ancestors and his tribe is to make a family, protect and provide for them, be industrious, and pass your traditions to your children.   &gt;Wiccans embrace homosexuality and look how messed up they are. I think there is no place for homosexual behavior in heathenry.   No you're not a bigoted dick at all.

0,But see, that makes things worse. Even if this were true, it's like they are saying that its better for you to have a really bad (and avoidable) childhood and still be straight in the end than to have a loving home and stable childhood and end up gay. Like it is better to be with abusive hetero parents than happy gay ones.  Obviously, heterosexuality should be prioritized over having a happy and great childhood!

0,Any kind of feedback would be good. If it tells me I'm crap at it, wouldn't that motivate me to get better at detecting whether or not someone is cheating?   Make it a flair or a coin that we can put on display. Tiered coins showing where we fall in the overall standing as far as overwatch.  1. Top 1% 2. Top 5% 3. Top 10% 4. Top 25% 5. Top 50%  I wouldn't recommend anything lower than that to discourage trolls from trying to have the worst tiered coin. eg worst 1%.  They already have a list of where everyone in overwatch stands based on how their decisions are weighted, how fucking hard is it to make 5 coins and impliment a system for us to show off overwatch e-peen? 
0,Edit: wasn't looking to attack you, was checking if you had any bad habbits to use as an example :p  Misconceptions? Dude, I did my drugtour myself in the day. And my friends and I did it in an educated and responsible way. That shit fucks with the body.  I still like to light up a nice little sticky myself on occasion as well, don't give me that bullshit. It IS unhealthy, you're still inhaling smoke/vapor. Sure, vapor is healthier, doesn't mean it's healthy. There is MORE than enough research and evidence that smoking pot can cause mental and other health issues.  PS: yes, I am fat, no, you didn't insult me. Want to know how I got fat? Years of antidepressants. Quit them 2 years ago. Bloated me up like a balloon, can't lose weight. Want to know what I eat? 2 slices of bread at noon, a slice of light cheese, a piece of fruit (apple, orange mostly), in the evening I eat like normal person would. Vegetables and maybe a couple of potatoes, hardly eat any meat. I don't have a car so I walk. Everywhere. I go swimming twice a week as well. No weightloss. Have been doing this for over 2 years. Still fat. Sorry if your taxes still pay for my bad judgement...

0,So to understand the title you've got to break it down: ""Disciple"": phonetically that's ""Dis"" + ""Iple"". ""Diss"" is like an insult, something negative you say about another person or thing. Whereas ""Iple"" is like apple, except a bit garbled, cut up you might say. What does the apple represent? Adam &amp; Eve, the fall from grace of humanity - Genesis, basically. So if you think about it hard enough, it becomes pretty clear that Kevin is criticizing (""Dissing"") misconstrued or somehow imperfect depictions/understanding of mankind's defiance of God (Old Testament style). The lyrics of the song make it unambiguous that this is the proper interpretation. Glad to help!! :)  Edit:

0,Why the fuck should it matter if they did or didn't?  There's a little thing called ""Modded Servers"". They exist for a reason to separate those who wanna play vanilla and those who wanna play with mods. With Modded Servers in GTA IV and San Andreas, you would need all the specific mods that server has to even play them.  These servers never harmed anyone and never effected anyone's gaming experience who wanted to play Vanilla whatsoever.  If Rockstar was smart, they would have it so that all mods in unmodded servers would automatically be disabled, and everything would be set back vanilla automatically upon joining an unmodded server with mods installed.  But no, apparently that's too simple for them to do just like they did with GTA IV.

0,&gt;Grapjes over politici ten spijt, is het natuurlijk pure ongelijkheid dat je hier loopt te verdedigen. Vernederen van communisten, hippies, liberalen, PVV'ers - allemaal prima, maar denk er niet over om moslims te vernederen...  Welke conclusie je hieruit trekt moet je zelf weten (en er is voor veel standpunten iets te zeggen), maar er is wel een belangrijk verschil: politieke spotprenten gaan over (potentiële) bestuurders van ons land. In een (representatieve) democratie is het belangrijk dat mensen een geïnformeerde stem kunnen uitbrengen en daarom moeten de kanalen voor politieke verslaggeving beschermd worden tegen de overheid (die andere belangen heeft dan de burger). De Islam is *geen* politieke partij, maar er is wel een *minderheid* van Moslims in ons land. Zij moeten zelfs tot op zekere hoogte beschermd worden (en ook over deze mate van bescherming zijn meerdere standpunten in te nemen).  Edit: jullie downvotes brengen mijn vrijheid van meningsuiting in gevaar. Ik ga jullie elke dag belachelijk maken tot mijn mening ge-upvote wordt!

When I first encountered Borges I was studying Lterature so most people seemed to regard Pierre Menard as his most important piece... and while it is important indeed it almost feels trivial next to something like *Funes the Memorious* or *The Library of Babel*  Borges was an extrordinary man. I just can't speak too highly of him.  The Nobel Prize for Literature committee should have performed ritual Seppuku in disgrace when Borges passed without his due recognition.

Tagore - as a strong supporter of the Bengali Independence movement - likely would have seen a big difference between what you see as an amorphous mass called India and what he likely saw as a bunch of regional kingdoms (Mysore, Punjab, Bengal, etc).  Sorta like how Germany and France (or should I say Normandy and Barvaria?) are really just part of that amorphous place called Europe...  Edit:  apparently I've offended the nationalists who only see the world in black and white.  Now that the political label is India, clearly, everything there is ""Indian"" first and foremost.

0,Yikes, I feel like we know the same woman. Teen mom, horrible pregnancies and miscarriages, always suffering from incredible pain and dire infections. After her second child, her doctors told her that a third could mean her death.   So what does she do? Purposefully gets pregnant and has a third baby to, her words, ""prove him wrong."" She nearly bleeds out during the birth, leaving her husband to juggle three babies and a job for a week while she recovers and posts all over FB about God's little miracles.   What a wonderful situation!

0,[jaggies](http://forums.ni.com/t5/imageerverpage/image-id/23874i923C9AF031B29657?v=mpbl-1). Maybe a slang term not all that many have heard of. It's the edges of rendered polygons that have the stair step look. The effect is lessened by both higher resolution and AA.  That's the thing. I may be sacrificing settings, but in the end the game looks significantly better to *me*. Really though, the lower settings don't make a large impact on looks while playing the game pretty often. I've compared 1080 right next to 4K and the 1080 picture in game just looks awful. I personally choose lower setting with higher resolution over low res high settings. It's great seeing a personal preference getting downvoted though

It's important to notice the subtlety in how Rodney talks about quitting because it's for strategy. It's also like how he says mean things for strategy. And like, is saying women should hold themselves to a higher standard because men are dogs but women should be angels really even that bad in the first place?

For centuries the Marches on either side of the boundary was an area of mixed allegiances, **where families or clans switched which country or side they supported as suited their family interests at that time**, and lawlessness abounded. Before the personal union of the two kingdoms under James, **the border clans would switch allegiance between the Scottish and English crowns depending on what was most favourable for the members of the clan**. For a time a powerful local clan dominated a region on the border between England and Scotland. It was known as the Debatable Lands and neither monarch's writ was heeded.""    Yeah that really sounds like a sharply delineated ethnic division

It took me a while to figure out what was going on though.  I haven't watched it yet since I'm currently watching about 10 shows at once, but I will watch it after Welcome to the NHK.

The game's economy will be based on microtransactions and incentivizing a constant stream of new players to the game in order to continue selling microtransactions, new players you will have to play with no matter how many friends you can get to play it with you because your friends will presumably not always be available.

0,Good points, especially the one about how Gilbert Arenas etc is better at judging players than basketball analytics guys. People think we're moving to a more enlightened era of judging players with analytics but we're really moving backwards because we're often ignoring former NBA players' opinions, and these opinions hold much more truth than analytics produced by guys who probably never even played in Division 1 NCAA let alone the NBA. These players were actually on the court to experience the players first-hand rather than just watching them from the stands or on TV and without the knowledge that only comes from being an NBA player.

Protecting it with larger patrols, or galleys, which were also used for trading, would make sense.   To me, reasoning only merchant ships can protect trade makes me imagine a police made up of wall street stock traders or something.  Galleys are OP if you play in Europe basically, if your nation is not in the baltic or the Mediterranean, galleys lose a lot of use. But THAT is stupid too, give the cheap to build and maintain ships to the region that has the most money. Let Africa build heavies, they can sure afford them!

0,Feel free to ignore the question or tell me to fuck off, but do you use?   I ask because I've had friends ask and while I do use, I'm obviously not about to start telling everyone who asks (no matter how close we are). Most of my friends don't lift and their knowledge of steroids comes from the media. I honestly don't care enough to try and explain the misconceptions regarding steroid use.   I did it with my girlfriend because we're living together now and I wasn't about to try and hide it inside my own home.   My friends know how much I train, they see my diet, they understand I'm committed. So a ""no, I'm not,"" is enough for them. They don't understand what's naturally attainable and what isn't.   At the end of the day, part of the reason I use steroids is because the physique I want is achievable only with gear. So for those in the gym who are knowledgeable about bodybuilding and steroids, there's no reason to ask.   It's unfortunate that strangers feel it appropriate to ask if you use. I've lifted with some of these guys for 2-3 years and yet we still don't outright discuss our use. It's all done as a hypothetical. Some people just have no common sense, ""oh yeah, of course I'll admit my illegal drug use to you, person I've never met before.""

0,Yeah because people who can afford to put 10,000$ a year away on top of maxing out thier RRSPs can't afford to pay taxes. The Conservatives certainly don't go out of thier way to offer tax benefits aimed at the wealthy families. In fact the income splitting initiative benefits everyone!

0,Considering the subject of this TIL, and many other threads, are about men suffering from the repercussions of false rape allegations, while their false-accusers go free without anything to resemble justice, I'd say the evidence begs to differ, and that yes, these cases are about Men suffering, as a demographic that face unfair consequences when falsely accused.  Let's count the ways society ""Does not fall over itself to help women"", shall we? We have Affirmative Action (Or as some call it in a solipsistic manner, ""Positive Discrimination"", as if there could be such a thing), we have the general aforementioned leniency in sentencing that you conveniently ignored, we have woman-only gyms and other ""Safe Spaces"" for women to congregate and socialize outside of interacting with men (While the same concept for men was demonized as sexist and discriminatory only a couple decades ago), and the ""Listen and Believe"" line being pushed on college campuses that has now led to a complete violation, yet again, of Title IX in their zealotry to ""Protect the Womynz"", which was done at their behest, I might add.  None of these benefits are extended to men. In fact, given the statistics on [health research alone,](http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx) with research expenditures for Breast Cancer at $715 Million, Uterine Cancer at $40 Million, and Women's Health at a whopping total of $3,891,000,000 the amount spent on any field remotely benefitting men looks like a pittance, with Prostate Cancer at $284 Million, and absolutely zilch, zip, nada for either Testicular Cancer or Men's Health. We are largely left to fend for ourselves in the private sector for our healthcare research, which if you are familiar with anything in regards to research and funding, depending on private backers only means research is agonizingly slow without public funds. When the grand total of public healthcare costs in major gender-specific health issues ($4,576,000,000 for women, versus $40,000,000 for men) do not even come down to men even getting 1% of what is spent on women's health issues, and yet you claim that ""Society does not fall over itself to help women"", it makes it perfectly clear who the ignorant one here is.  Edit: Oh, wow...this is rich. I never expected somebody that let their subjectivity influence their arguments so badly would be a Teacher! I was expecting some fast-food worker or perhaps a Women's Studies major. Well, I guess this is Positive Discrimination at work, reducing the standards for getting the job done to the lowest common denominator in the name of ""Equality of Outcome"".

0,You notice the down votes in this sub which tends to put the concept of ""justice"" on a pedestal that is unaffected by politics because they put on robes to cover their street clothes.  I described the two tiered analysis of rational basis and strict scrutiny that is present in the US cases.  It basically determines the result--if a law only needs a rational basis, it will be held to be constitutional; if a law must be justified under strict scrutiny (a compelling state interest accomplished using the least intrusive means available) the laws are generally unconstitutional.  There have been two outliers--Japanese internment camps and travel to Cuba where laws have survived strict scrutiny.  The US paid reparations for the former and history will judge us poorly for the latter.  Where a law disproportionately impacts either a fundamental right or a ""suspect"" class (race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and in some states sexual orientation) the courts will use strict scrutiny and all these laws appear doomed.  Our Federal judges are appointed for life, but the state/county judges are usually elected.  George W Bush appointed his DOJ Attorney Libby who had written the memo justifying the torture in Guantanemo and the other black sites to a life time federal judgship.  Makes me so proud.

0,I guess it would have to be when someone who is very overweight or obese offers me diet tips and they themselves have not lost any weight to back it up.   It takes all I got not to ask them why it isn't working for them. It's even worse when they are eating something terrible like a whopper while trying to explain how it has all the food groups in it.   Another one would be my boyfriend and I watched the movie fed up the other night. Immediately afterwards we went to see the new avengers movie. When walking to the theater I saw a massive add your own popcorn butter machine. I have to admit after watching fed up the machine really grossed both of us out. I also noticed how many severely overweight people had giant tubs of popcorn and wondered quietly how much serve your own butter they used. The concept wouldn't be that terrible if people actually used it in moderation but I'm sure a large amount just dump it in like gravy.   One I experienced last week someone asked me what I had done to loose weight (I've lost 51lbs). When I told them I was counting calories and started to show them my fitness pal she said oh that's too much work and walked off.   Last but not least is one I myself have made the mistake of. Oh I did a lot of exercise. Great job I deserve this cake, cookies, and chocolate as a reward... all at once. Why am I not losing weight?

We've seen one rendition of Gaming on it, the rest were either day to day activities, or targeted activities, such as 3D modeling and architecture stuff, etc.  Plus, everybody knows Microsoft has ALL of it's budget tied up in strictly Xbox sales, and if it doesn't do well, then obviously Microsoft will fail as a business.

Boxers generally do not go for grabs/clenches unless they are under heavy pressure. Mac wouldn't need to have one that kills. That being said, his down throw can follow into an Up B to kill on some of the cast.  * 3. Besides pocketed/reflected moves, I don't think anything breaks an entire shield on 1-hit. Oil Panic not included since it is an absorption.  * 4. This is not a bad idea. All counters should have variations like Shulk and Greninja. Except Lucario. Screw that Aura wielding prick.

0,Because it's political bullshit, even if the President's intentions are good there's not much he can do given the millions of things standing in his way.  In fact, we should set up some sort of government where the President has all the power. So he can do what's best for the country without political obstacles getting in the way.

0,Okay so I'm into the 9/11 conspiracy. I'm not going to say some ""irrefutable evidence"" or whatever. My personal opinion is that there were too many fucked up things that happened that day, and it seems really fishy to me. However, I don't actually know. I mean I'm 21 and uneducated. I'm not a building designer or an engineer or some shit. I get into arguments with people often about this on both sides, and they both piss me off. I hate the conspiracy people who tell me that they know for sure what happened and if I question them that I am just an idiot who believes whatever I'm told by the mainstream media, and I also hate the people who immediately say ""you're crazy if you question the official story you stupid conspiracy theorist!"". To me its like two sides of the same coin, just people picking one side and not thinking critically about it. I can't tell you if WTC 7 was a controlled demolition or if there were explosives in the buildings or Larry Silverstein had anything to do with it. I have watched some youtube videos and news stories though, just like 99% of people who argue for or against the conspiracy. I just feel like people on BOTH sides of this issue should be a lot more open minded about it.  By the way I think the chemtrail theory is false and I have actually gotten into an argument with someone who thinks chemtrails are real and that 9/11 was not a conspiracy, and that I was stupid for questioning the 9/11 story. It blew my mind.   Anyway I just wanted to say please don't think all conspiracy people are insane, to me its just about being open minded. Questioning these things is healthy, being an asshole isn't. And to add another conspiracy to your list there is the disinformation conspiracy, that the CIA and the powers that be create a lot of the conspiracy theories that exist by spreading false info, which is thrown up on /r/conspiracy and other forums which then discredits those places of discussion, which I personally believe is fairly likely.  Anyway have a nice day, and be sure to research reptilian shapeshifters

I don't know what the right word for it is...musicianship? tightness? soul? Whatever it is, the biscuits don't have it.  I think on a good night they're next in line in the scene, but on a bad night I'd put bands like STS9 and Lotus ahead of them for sure.

0,Liberia was established as a colony of the United States to dump freed black slaves into because white people didn't want free black people in the US.  Black people were strongly encouraged by white colonial societies to emigrate there where they eventually managed to gain a foothold, declare independence, and proceeded to brutally subjugate the locals for the next 150 years. All while propped up by the United States.  This segregationist society (Americans vs natives) persisted throughout most of the 20th century culminating in a coup and eventual civil war which lasted over a decade during which there was extensive child soldiering, slavery, rape and widespread pillaging and indiscriminate murder of civilians along other war crimes.   That's thankfully over now and Libera has emerged as only the fourth poorest country in the entire world.   So yes, blacks were emigrating there *during the slavery era over a hundred years ago*, because it was a white plan to get rid of them (the locals be damned). And what a great success it turned out.

There is no way, no possible way that he is being intelligent by avoiding a split vote with the Democratic Candidate at the general were he to run as an Independent. There is no way that he is maintaining his ideals and making a functional, intelligent decision to ensure that his campaign does not inadvertently elect a Republican candidate.

0,Yeah, but its true... her Mom married her Dad after he already had a thriving business, making around $50,000 a year (his salary) in 1978 (which was a hell of a lot back then).  On top of that, for the first 6 years he started his business, he took 50% of his salary and invested heavily on Proctor &amp; Gamble, which is where the bulk of their wealth comes from now.  I was talking with him recently and he said he owns around 300,000 shares.  I picked up my smartphone to Google Finance ""PG"".  I guess he knew what I was doing, because he looked at me and said, ""Its around $24,000,000, Rath.""  The really fucking nutty part is that their dividend payouts have been around $0.64 a share, which means for the past few years he's been getting another $190,000~ every 3 months.  So honestly what's $30,000 to him?  Its like two weeks of dividend payouts.  I honestly don't know why he didn't just buy it outright for her, but I guess he wants to instill some level of responsibility into her, especially since he came up dirt poor.  I feel sorry for whoever marries her, but at least they'll be comforted by all the cash they'll inherit, since he has four children and they're all getting an equal split of the family assets.  Sure, that knocks the dividend payments to $16,000 a month for each of them, but that's already damn near double what I take home, so I'm sure they'll find a way to live...

0,&gt; What if you're parked and someone is driving by?  Place your foot on the brake, and shift into Drive.  This allows you to physically drive your car.  Especially handy for police officers who need to follow a certain vehicle.  &gt; we all know that headlights give 100% visibility from 100 feet away.....  Yeah those little 99 cent license plate bulbs sure give superior visibility over HIGH BEAMS!

0,&gt;I'm pretty sure that if there was an actual real problem, then Riot would fix it pretty damn quick.  In the face of some four-five years of them obviously showing otherwise? Alright.  &gt; If you actually knew how the internet worked, then I might actually listen to you, but you make it really apparent that you do not.  Says the guy who who is convinced that thousands of people with different ISPs, connections and bandwidth, specs and routing paths are all too stupid to check if their internet is faulty, as opposed to there maybe being an issue on Riot's side? That makes sense.

0,...toppest of keks. I don't suppose you've ever heard of the concept of 'metaphors'? 'Allegories'? 'Analogies'? Don't tell me you actually took that seriously?  Besides; looking at the heaps of whining and outrage over the big bad cheaters back when there was no script hook detection - and no false positive bans, imagine that - one could very well assume someone walked into a mall with a bomb and blew it up.  I'm going to leave this right here before you take that literally, too:

0,It's almost like feminists only ever complain about getting the cushy, well-paying jobs with good benefits. Sewage worker? Cable repairwoman? Construction? Mining? Pffft that's too risky, women certainly can't be expected to do that. This mentality absolutely isn't self-defeating at all.

0,Win rates shouldn't govern his specific balancing requirement. The fact that they didn't notice he had a 0% loss rate during Heroes of the Dorm was already proof enough for a slight nerf.  Illidan alone is a powerhouse that can negate AA, crush squishies, and has two unbelievably powerful Heroics. One allows him to gain an entirely new life bar just by being in a team fight scenario, and thus allowing him to mop the floor with an already exhausted team.  The second is a global damage teleport that allows him to pick out anyone who is too far extended and destroy them in a matter of moments.  None of this includes the team supporting him. I've personally played on a pre-made team first timing Illidan in a competitive scenario, all it took was a Lili and Abathur to make me immortal. I literally continued to kill them as they spawned out of their base to stop me from taking the lane down to their core... I wasn't even playing optimal or being strategic at all. Just hardcore ham and it's still viable.  Yet, a nerf isn't required, I'm sure.

0,&gt; if housing wasn't so appallingly expensive then people could afford a better life  That is true, but that's not me saying homes should be cheaper, rather than more people should be able to afford to buy homes. Something like HALF of home owners technically can't afford their homes. That is a crazy high number, half of home owners are house poor?! Maybe they should stop living above their means, but if that half of ALL home owners bought an affordable house, what would that do to the home construction market?  Yea, everything is fine.

0,Seeing this today in Michigan. We have an incredibly serious issue on raising the states income tax and adjusting of the gas tax to ""fix the roads"". Yet more people don't even know today is a voting day. At my precinct I was vote 120 of over 6000 eligible voters.   The apathy towards anything except a presidential race is why our country is deadlocked and awful. People rail on Facebook saying our country is turning into a dictatorship. It's possible because ALL you care about is one position in office, so there should be more power to the executive if this is what's most important

If they wanted to convey the message that Watson was cleared of any wrong-doing, they would issue a statement indicating that they had investigated and nothing was found. As it is, Campbell's comments can easily be interpreted as ""Watson is a 20 year veteran, he would never say something like that, therefore the comments are baseless"". Which is also essentially what Kerry Fraser has been saying since the incident, except Fraser is more ""Watson is a referee, refs don't say things like that, therefore the comments are baseless"".  And good job toning down the sarcasm.

It’s sound advice, particularly in the context of online harassment campaigns, where people who think of themselves as feminists—or at least don’t think of themselves as misogynists—hurl abuse at women on social media.  Aw well gawrsh, I bet I could find some ""vitriolic"" tweets from male ""feminists"" thrown at women just for being pro-GamerGate, I didn't realize Whedon was looking for examples.  We could have nipped this in the bud ages ago, I'm sure....

So, once again, this is a principle that someone is scared of being **thought of** as arrogant and thus their response to this is ban anyone who could think that...  But it's not censorship, because only the government can do that. 
0,Here's an example of actual ableism; some fuckhead claiming to be autistic when they aren't, and then talking over actual autistic people.  And by actual autistic I mean ME.  Do you know how fucking much therapy has helped me to feel more confident because I've learned how to control some of my behaviors that would make me seem weird to others? Do you know how fucking much that has helped me psychologically?  Oh wait, that's right. On Tumblr, you're shamed and sent death threats if you dare try and grow as a human being. Tumblr doesn't want me to feel good about myself and proud of my achievements. They want me to be the uncontrollable, depressed, suicidal, borderline insane teenager I was back in 2012 who would stress vomit from merely the *thought* of going out in public.   The thought of me learning how to handle being in public makes Tumblrinas gag at the thought. How dare I control and manage the issues that come with me being autistic! Why would I *ever* want to be able to go in public and not vomit from being so terrified?

0,&gt; insists you help with dinner whilst you're jet-lagged and tired    &gt; She calls me immediately to go prepare dinner with her.      So basically she called out ""hey, wanna help me make dinner?""    He had every chance to say ""sorry sweetie, I'm not feeling all that well. I'm too tired from the long trip.""   Not sure where you get the ""insists"" from.    &gt; and mocks you    Just hearsay from him, I'm afraid. That's how he took what she said. Could have not been mocking at all, or intentionally have sounded like it. Which does happen.    &gt; didn't ask if you are okay    Anyone who ever does any cooking has had boiling water or grease on their hands at one time or another. Rinse with cold water. Problem solved. No grown person runs off and cries like a child. It's not like she had to even ask if she was standing next to him and saw it happen. I bet the worst he has is a little red spot on his hand that feels sore.    &gt; refuses to apologise or acknowledge wrong-doing  Because she didn't really do much wrong whatsoever. She laughed at something she found was funny. No harm was done.  &gt; tries to twist the blame on you (you say this is a regular occurrence)    Again, only from what he says. We don't know how the actual conversations went. He might be projecting or taking things much too personally like he did in the original incident.    &gt; questions your masculinity    ""man up"" is an expression so very many people use. And I'm willing to bet 99% of people don't use it in a way to question someone's masculinity. It's essentially saying ""stop being such a baby"".    &gt; Doesn't sound like this is a relationship worth saving.    Because yeah, a misunderstanding and a possibly inapropriate laugh is reason to break up.

0,There's pretty much nothing that they can do about it, once you've lost your save data. While the relevant data is saved both locally and in the Steam cloud, the latter is updated by default after you've run the game, meaning that your cloud saves would also have been overwritten due to this bug. The save data is not stored anywhere else. The only chance of recovery would therefore be if you (or your OS) made backups previously.  But maybe they'll be generous and give us you another 10k gold to spend in the crypt.

0,OP didn't ask for the most accurate hacking scene, stupid. 
0,No. You can just keep downloading the 4 GB package over and over. The reason that you can't download more than 4 GB at once is because when you download it, the RAM goes from your download folder into your vDIMM slots (also known as vRAM, v stands for virtual). Check the type of GPU (Geometric Programmable (RAM) Unifier) and if your computer only has 2 GB of vRAM, it will only let you download 2GB at once. You can still download the 4 GB package but it will have to download 2 GB twice, not 4 GB all at once. You can download as much RAM as your SSD (Selective Sender (of) Data) can hold. Just make sure you do not download it to your HDD (Handy Data Deleter) as your RAM will get deleted immediately. And don't download too much since it will overflow your computer's mainframe and cause your Optical Drive to take up too many stream processors which makes your heatsink start to float and that will make your PC's Motherboard IO plate to fall off, thus ruining your whole PC. I know all of this because I am an IT professional.

0,You are right this so called ""wage gap"" does exist, but not for the reasons that the feminists try to make people believe. There are several reasons for this.   1.Women generally negotiate less when they apply for a job or ask for a raise. WOW less money must be patrichasrsay!!!2111111!!!  2.Women generally work in public sector which tend to pay less, than the private sector, where men generally end up working. MUST be prataticallly11111!!!!!!!!\  3.Women generally get degrees that wind them up working in care taking jobs and men generally get degrees that wind them up working in better paying industries like STEM fields. Must be pratrically!111!.   4.Women generally get pregnant and then they will be out of the workforce for at least a year to give birth to the child and take care of it for the first year. A good portion of them only return to work part time and some of them even stop working altogether. Again the patriarchy strikes again!  It is so oppressive to give women the freedom to choose things. They are obviously children, who can't take care of themselves.

She was in between jobs and she was without insurance for a month (yay US healthcare system), and so we went to the catholic hospital on the other side of town thinking they would show her some mercy in her situation.  Instead they gave her rushed and poor care. They said there was no break, but when she went to university hospital a month later when she was at her new school teaching they found it right away. Then they treated her like she was just faking it in an attempt to score some pain meds, and released her telling her to just get some tylenol at the store. Then a few days later she got a bill for over $3000 in the mail.  That is a hell of a charity.

Some have two mothers or two fathers. Some live with grandparents or with caregivers. We may come from different cultures. We also have different talents and abilities and different things that we find difficult to do.”  Teacher: “How can you be a role model and show respect for differences in other people?”  Student: “I can include others in what I am doing, invite them to join a group, be willing to be a partner with anyone for an activity, and be willing to learn about others.”   how can anyone support such a *scandalous* curriculum?

Ah, yes, those wonderful schools destroyed by Horace Mann, as they were when described by, e.g. the Massachusetts School Law of 1642:  &gt; Also that all masters of families do once a week (at the least) catechize their children and servants in the grounds &amp; principles of Religion, &amp; if any be unable to do so much: that then at the least they procure such children or apprentices to learn some short orthodox catechism without book, that they may be able to answer unto the questions that shall be propounded to them out of such catechism by their parents or masters or any of the Select men when they shall call them to a tryall of what they have learned of this kind. And further that all parents and masters do breed &amp; bring up their children &amp; apprentices in some honest lawful calling, labour or employment, either in husbandry, or some other trade profitable for themselves, and the Common-wealth if they will not or cannot train them up in learning to fit them for higher employments. And if any of the Select men after admonition by them given to such masters of families shall find them still negligent of their duty in the particulars aforementioned, wherby children and servants become rude, stubborn &amp; unruly; the said Select men with the help of two Magistrates, or the next County court for that Shire, shall take such children or apprentices from them &amp; place them with some masters for years (boyes till they come to twenty one, and girls eighteen years of age compleat) which will more strictly look unto, and force them to submit unto government according to the rules of this order, if by fair means and former instructions they will not be drawn into it.

0,The in-your-face nature of atheism is purely reactionary. I would argue  that it's not even mostly in your face. The minority of atheists are rude. It's just that the nature of religion is so fucking weird, that if you are not religious, that is an automatic IN YOUR FACE to religious people. So the deck is already stacked against us.  I digress, atheist activism is purely reactionary. If Christians didn't get off on authoritarianism and demagoguery, there would be no reason for atheists to speak because they would be happy living a life free of prejudice and discrimination; spirituality would be a non-issue. That's not the case, though. Religious people love to spread their shit and piss other people off. So obviously it's the atheists who are to blame. They started it by refusing to submit!

0,I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but I don't understand the freak out over prioritization. I regularly use 20-40GB per month on my phone, mainly due to streaming tv shows from my server at home. (I almost never tether... in the past year, I'd be surprised if I hit 1GB total)  Because of prioritization and usage in the area, I know I can't stream shows during my lunch break, so I use yatse to download them earlier in the day so I can just play them on my device during my lunch, then I just delete the file once I've watched it (yatse has a fairly decent interface for this).  I'm not a fan of occasional slower speeds, but considering how much data I use and the price I pay, I'm more than understanding. I don't think this is ever meant to be permanent, and hopefully with the impending tower upgrades in the area, it'll lower the congestion during lunch so I can go back to streaming.  But if you think you can use almost 100GB of data on other carriers, good luck with that. Maybe you should move to Google Fi and pay ridiculous amounts for the data you're using...

0,&gt;Latter-day Saints’ doctrine of exaltation is often similarly reduced in media to a cartoonish image of people receiving their own planets.  &gt;A cloud and harp are hardly a satisfying image for eternal joy, although most Christians would agree that inspired music can be a tiny foretaste of the joy of eternal salvation. Likewise, while few Latter-day Saints would identify with caricatures of having their own planet, most would agree that the awe inspired by creation hints at our creative potential in the eternities.  It's not just a planet, it is worlds without number, you godless heathens!

0,It's an easy solution. Make it law that if a man would opt for an abortion, and the woman doesn't want the abortion that the man does not owe her allimony.  The argument for this is simple. Either both parents have to accept responsibility for the child at conception, or both parents can opt out of being parents after conception. If a woman can choose to abort, then the father should be able to as well, or at the very least opt out of those responsibilities.  .  This law of course requires abortion to be legal. In regions where it is not legal, this would be unfair.  .  But yeah, woman want to be able to have their cake and eat it to when it comes to ""reproductive rights."" But women are oppressed in america so the evil men will get their way right? 
0,Haha thanks. And I actually agree with Flannery on that one, but I'm afraid that would complicate the shit out of what I'm trying to say (despite that Flannery was, given the evidence, very in favor of formal instruction--didn't she also say, ""Many a bestseller ought to have been prevented by a good teacher"" or something like it...?).  Not that anyone here reads Flannery O'Connor, though. Why would they have to? After all, they were all born with an expert understanding of literature and the English language, which is why you'd have to be a complete idiot to spend money on a writing degree.

0,The cow spawners are there as a result of mobs stacking. It's the best situation to minimize lag when it comes to passive mobs. Gets rid of some lag but still allows for people to get leather for books.  They're only there for leather, the steak is irrelevant as most factions have potato farms by now so it's really not a big deal.  I'm sure having 200 cows in your base, creating massive amounts of lag, is a better option

0,That looks more to me like investors that chose to invest at the wrong time, got burned, and wanted to get at least some of their money back by blaming the company.  There's no doubt in my mind that at the time what Sprint and Nextel jointly claimed was what they had planned, and it simply didn't go according to plan (partially due to the ineptitude of Gary Forsee). Those investors saw that as an opportunity to make a claim they were lied to and try and save some face while making some money back.  EDIT: After reading more of the article...  &gt; The lead plaintiffs are the United Steelworkers' Pace Industry Union-Management Pension Fund, Skandia Life Insurance Co and the West Virginia Investment Management Board.   &gt; Their lawyers, led by Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd and Motley Rice, said the payout represented 12.1 percent of the estimated $1.079 billion of damages, a percentage they called ""very large.""   So they were simply willing to take 12% of the estimated damages as a settlement... instead of actually litigating to potentially get more compensation. Not to mention the lawyers taking 22% of that plus an additional $4 million as payment. That doesn't look like their claim was shaky *at all*.

When the content is driven so heavily by other players you never know what you're going to run into and that's the true beauty of both this and DayZ.  Shit, half the time I feel like they're both equally buggy too.

0,A little more color for the people that have asked questions.  * This was in the early 1990's. That $200K would be $330K in 2015 dollars. * This was a base salary + commissions + bonuses sales job. * This was a position in the software industry so a base salary of $50-100K would be the norm at the time.   * Sales jobs are usually described as 50-50/60-40/65-35 etc. where the first number is the base salary and the second number is the commissions plus the bonuses ""at plan"". * At plan = The amount of commissionable revenue the sales person is expected to earn for the company so the company can make its business plan. It's also referred to as ""quota"" or ""at budget"". * Once you make plan commissions can get very interesting. I have worked and managed plans that provided double and triple commissions once you exceed your quota. I've also seen plans with large bonuses for deals of a certain size, specific products sold, etc. * Today, a good salesperson with a 50-50 plan, commissions that escalate above plan and a base salary of $100-125K can make $750K-$1M+ if they have an exceptional year. * This particular fellow did not go into much detail. He was recently let go from a company that had downsized (remember that term?) and had a chip on his shoulder the size of a large parrot. His comment, which was delivered with a condescending scowl, conveyed this thought, ""If YOU can't put $200K in MY pocket, then it's not worth my time."" * This position required 50% office time and 50% travel time so, yeah, he'd have to get out of bed.

I love everyone's thought process on reddit, like Dyrus and other professional players are these godly machines who don't have human emotions - there is so much to look at and consider in the scenario, how his day was going, was he on a losing spree, was he tired, and most importantly the interactions that took place before that picture.  The man says one thing to get an annoying guy off his back who took his lane, and complained when he does something poorly in a role he doesn't main, and he is a ""Grade A douche bag who is condescending"".   It's like you guys expect them to all be these pacifist, wise old men who don't let anything phase them - they are teens and young adults not much older than majority of us - yet you act surprised and judge them if they slip up once.. I'm sure you have never said something out of anger or spite, because you are one of those ""nice"" guys.  But yeah, that is Dyrus for sure, the biggest douche bag NA.

I have to add, even asking a couple times every few weeks could be considered ""all the time"" when someone is dealing with something traumatic. He explained how uncomfortable he was, she continued with no respect for his feelings or boundaries. Not cool in my opinion.   Not to mention at the end of the post where she is clearly emotionally blackmailing him with the push in totally unrelated areas of their life.  Clearly she cares about him and his feelings.

0,You'd really think that, if anyone had been able to replicate this effect, it would be everywhere. But no, I've found many pages talking about the problems with the original study with reference to why the results haven't been reproduced, a few people making the vague assertion that the effect has been replicated, but no instances of another study showing the same thing.  Here's a quote from the original paper: &gt;""In such a study, the difficulties are formidable. The first and main hazard was that many of these patients had inadequate personalities. At worst they would cheat and lie, obtaining food from visitors, from trolleys touring the wards, and from neighboring patients. At best, they cooperated fully, but a few found the diet so trying that they could not eat the whole of their meals. When this happened, the rejected part was weighed, and the equivalent calories and foodstuffs were added to a meal later in the day. The results we report are selected, a considerable number of known failures in discipline being discarded.""  Yeah. That sounds reliable.

0,Gotta love the people who think everyone everywhere works on commission. It's the first indication to me that they've never had a retail job and have no clue what they're talking about. I used to work in the custom framing department of a craft store, and people were always shocked by the price of custom framing, and quite a few even tried to accuse me of jacking up the price to ""scam"" them or ""earn more commission."" Even when I laughed and said I'd love to earn more than just minimum wage, I was just treated like I was lying.   Yeah, how shocking that custom creating a one-of-a-kind item just for you and meticulously putting it together is going to cost considerably more than if you just buy premade frames off the shelf and do it yourself. It couldn't possibly be that you should pay a premium for that service, it must be that I'm a scammer. 
0,No, not really.   Rad LD is a bit better than it was (which was horrible) and you can get a bit of use out of Solar Crest instead of needing to go AC 3rd item every game.   Aghs is a great 8th item after you've already fallen off though, so there's that.

0,And yet this report says absolutely nothing definitively. All it does is show that the NFL absolutely refuses to take blame for anything. Nothing about refs not writing down measurements, not making sure the balls were secure... The fact that a ref was fired for stealing balls to sell. Hiring a horribly biased investigator who hires an engineering firm known for lying and fabricating evidence.   You're right, it all looks like they didn't want the Patriots to be found responsible.

In another [article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/05/07/404898259/federal-court-bulk-collection-of-phone-metadata-is-illegal) they said:  &gt;The three-judge panel was asked to consider whether the program violated the Constitution. Instead, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel punted on the constitutional claim, deciding the program was simply not authorized by federal law.  They can just amend the law to make it legal.   Also: &gt;The appeals court did not issue an order to stop the collection of data, noting that parts of the Patriot Act including Section 215 will expire on June 1. Lynch said it is for Congress to make clear whether it considers the NSA program permissible.  So it's ruled illegal, but instead of issuing a court order to stop it they'll still let Congress decide if they want to renew it. Yeah, that makes sense.

0,Ah yes, the women's Olympic team which consists of players who can barely afford their own equipment, who have to work full time jobs even if they're in the women's ""pro"" league because the league doesn't pay them anything, who have to balance these full time jobs with physical training, practices and games, who are coached by less talented coaches, who are the few who persisted in this path even though there's no future in it for them, who had to achieve high marks in high school and college/university in order to be able to have any sort of career at the same time when these male junior players were living and breathing hockey and focusing all their energy and their parents' money into developing their hockey skills to the point where they'll be drafted into the NHL? That women's Olympic team?  I can see how that really proves your argument.

0,&gt; You won't make it to the next decade if you don't appease the share holders for next quarter.  And this is a societal issue.  Every time this bulshit comes up it's always this ambiguous entity called ""the shareholders"" and how every corporate management or executive is literally held hostage by them to seemingly, ""make profits at all costs"".  Horse shit way to do buisness in our complicated and modern world and I feel this is what every facet of our society (at least in the US) is turning to.  Maybe the shareholders, who are made up of investors of our country had better fucking ethics and morals this circular dillema wouldn't keep happening and the rest of the public wouldn't make excuses for why this is a terrible fucking way to set a precendent in the business world.  Wonder why there's wealth distribution problems?  Well of course not, but we have to appease the shareholders!

0,&gt; What do you mean create a theocratic king level vassal?  I mean to have a King of Ireland who is a bishop (holds a title called King-Bishop) as a vassal.  The whole idea is to use free investiture to put a family member (like a troublesome brother perhaps) on the throne of King Bishopric of Ireland and use that power to push him for the Papacy. According to [www.ckiiwiki.com/Papal_succession](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Papal_succession) he would gain a lot of ""papal suitability score"" from his secular power, dynasty prestige etc. And by having a friendly dynasty member as the Pope (who is also my vassal), I could excommunicate Christians as I please and call for crusades to whomever I wanted. What's not to like?    Also, fuck Ireland. 'Tis a silly place. :P

0,The two main pillars of the Social Justice ideology are postmodernism, which is the origin of critical theory, and feminist theory, which leans more towards the radical side of feminism. Both postmodernism and feminist theory promote the idea that facts are less significant than emotions, beliefs, and ""feelings"".  Postmodernism dictates that facts are a social construct supported by beliefs and emotions, so those beliefs and emotions are more important. Feminist theory dictates that facts are often created by male scientists and philosophers, and are therefore tools of the patriarchy used to suppress women. Facts must be subverted and replaced by in order for true equality to exist.  &gt;TRUTH AND MERIT ARE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS. WE NEED TO ABOLISH ALL TESTS FOR MERIT. WE NEED TO ENACT LAWS TO ENSURE THAT OUR METHODS CAN NEVER BE OVERTURNED. BOYCOTT AND ATTACK ANYONE WHO DISAGREES.  By all means, let's remove the rigorous examination and licensing requirements for water treatment plant operators, or doctors, or any other health and safety field. It's not like they're responsible for millions of lives or anything. Equal representation is more important than public health. Health is a social construct anyway.

Jesus saves us from our sins and makes us new creations (Romans something something) and that means if those blind people were *really* faithful and honest, they'd pray to sweet baby Jesus and be in a relationship with him and Jesus would deliver them from blindness. Anyone who says anti-blind conversion therapy and ""pray the blind away"" doesn't work is just justifying their own sinful blind lifestyle.

American and British are English Languages.   The difference lies in the national qualifier. American vs British.   Jesus... talk about nit-pick.

What if my boss finds my OkCupid account and it's like really important I discuss the details of my job and also what happened to me before I got to work that day because I tripped and fell and a sexy stranger helped me to my office but I was too worried he might be a murderer so I just directed him to my account but my boss overheard and that's how s/he knew how to find me even though I don't include my face, it was clear it was me because I have a picture of my dearly beloved cat Twinkles (RIP) on my desk and one of my profile pictures was of Twinkles and oh the dramz!

He didn't get rich by making a million pizzas a day himself. Quit with the worship of rich people and acting like it was only them, that's not reality. Nevermind the fact they also go rich because we all pool our money together to pay for things like roads, sewers, utilities etc.  But hey, i'm sure they just would have built every road themselves

Grognards assume that they can't possibly be the cause of anything wrong, so the reluctance of women to join the hobby must be because of an inherent incompatibility between women and our wonderful, superior hobby!

0,&gt; We simply don't have everything figured out.  We figured enough to know that forward is (technically...) possible and backwards not so much.  &gt; What? Solar power is free energy, and the initial cost of panels is going down. Why would it ever go up again long-term?  It's in development. And nothing so minuscule can power such thing. You're thinking conventionally as a vehicle travelling through space, we're talking about travelling through time.  &gt; Are you seriously claiming that no one will EVER get their hands on a nuclear device?   Well, I don't seem to remember my grandma having a nuclear missile in the garden or the neighbor having a nuclear power plant...   &gt; We've already lost track of plenty.  Yea, no, they're kinda big, hard to miss. Never heard of anyone losing track of a huge ass nuclear power plant.  &gt; If you can do it once, you can probably keep doing it. Name one man-made device that we're physically incapable of ever reproducing.  It's not a matter of reproducing, it's a matter of accessibility. We reproduced nuclear weapons countless times. Do you see college students walking around with nukes in their bags? Not every single technology ever invented is accessible to absolutely everyone. As I said, we have shuttles, try ""borrowing"" one... Some technologies will never be made available for free public use.  &gt; You seem to know an awful lot about a technology that hasn't been invented yet.  I know about technology that will never be accessible to everyone. Don't put nukes and shuttles on the same boat as guns and cars. And time travel is potentially far more dangerous than a nuke. LHC was also invented, does that mean that any average Joe can get to use it freely whenever he wants? You're thinking that time travel will be sooo easy to produce by... Samsung or Apple or Sony that it will cost $249,99 with a 2 year contract and every random schmuck can get one and flood the past with time travelers... Just like we flooded the world with nukes...

0,Yeah but I didn't want to be emotionally bothered. Its high school. Plus I found the book to be extremely boring and I found no connection with the characters, so I found it extremely difficult to read.

India desperately need more and better and bigger cities to accommodate growing population and migration from rural areas.

0,What's not to understand? All women want rough sex all the time. They've been bred to enjoy physical and emotional abuse - it's evolution. The takeover of society by feminist cabals made them think that wanting to be abused is wrong in order to strip men of their natural power but you can overcome that with some determination. There's no need for sexual consent - all women are automatically consenting just by breathing. If they didn't want to have sex they could just kill themselves, obviously. That's the way that all pre-feminist societies have thrived since the dawn of time - it's  science. So what's holding you back from getting laid? Just go out there and take what you want - you don't ask a cow for it's consent to milk it, why would you ask a woman to consent to sex? By the way, we don't advocate rape, we're not misogynists, and we're really all about self-improvement.

Instead of enjoying the PC you have (regardless of age or hardware), you should just junk it and work 2 full time jobs until you can build a PC that's better than the current gen consoles. Only then will you be deemed worthy enough to have leisure time.

I had less then 5 real issues with Verizon over that course of time and nothing but issues since switching to tmobile.  Sacramento CA here. I didn't receive any of my wife's texts all day until about 10pm. Nothing critical but still messed with my day. Then I received more missed texts from others this morning.  Then my Dad (also have him on my plan) called me upset because had been expecting to meet a customer and headed out to the wrong location since he received their text 12 hours late. This made him look bad to the customer, cost him the sale and pissed off his boss.  Tmobile support's response? Please restart your phone because we don't know of any issues.

However, I only want to pay for 50% of the rent as I will only be sleeping there. The rest of the time I will be outside of the unit working and enjoying the sun.

0,&gt; The court must hold a hearing to determine whether a youth or adult sentence should be imposed. Section 72 of YCJA The court must apply the sentencing principles to make the decision. The judge shall consider a pre-sentence report and may consider conference recommendations. The judge shall give the Crown, the youth and his or her parents an opportunity to be heard. Section 71 of YCJA The judge must also give reasons for the decision. If an adult sentence is imposed, then adult parole eligibility applies.

Make sure you stay clear of all those criminals and hang out with the right, white crowd.

0,&gt; I see you've blanketed all of UKIP as racists and bigots based on the actions of a few. &gt;   I don't actually think that, my turn-of-phrase was inappropriate. By ""full of"" I really meant ""riddled with"" - not that literally every UKIP supporter is a bigot (plenty of moderates who just want to leave the EU).  A more articulate way of putting it is that a) they are *riddled* with bigots at both junior and senior levels, and b) their own party leader has condoned racism, which indicates a laissez-faire attitude towards bigotry. Those types should not be in parliament.  &gt; There is nothing inherently racist in leaving the EU, reducing our foreign aid budget or having regulated immigration, however **this was the perception of the majority of the UK**.  Erm, no? The perception of the majority of the UK was that UKIP have many racists among their *senior* membership, as evidenced by their own leader [defending the use of racial slurs by his members](http://order-order.com/2014/12/19/watch-farage-defends-candidates-chink-comment/#_@/Nakvu1pqiFg3fg) and even [making racist comments himself](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27459923). They are not *just* an anti-EU party.  &gt; Let's not forget that Murdoch is mad keen on a tory government  Ah yes, that explains why his papers report just as many acts of bigotry perpetrated by Labour members as by UKIP members

I mean, it's not like he doesn't have to redeem himself against Pawn, or that there's a new bad boy in town that every single reddit thread that mentions his name hypes up(Febiven). I guess it's simply the fact that Faker wants to play only weak midlaners.

0,The lack of good widespread 3-4 damage AoE is also one of the driving forces behind mech aggro's success. It's almost like a lot of the main AoE spells were designed for a time when aggro largely relied on 1-2 toughness minions or something and Blizzard never realized that giving people the power to fill their board quickly with ?/3s and ?/4s for the same cost might create a giant fucking balance problem.

Even in their televised segments they have some good analysts on staff, plus their 30 for 30 series is spectacular. They produce a lot of crap too, but its not like they only churn out clickbait and reactionary nonsense.  They also don't focus on bullshit because it is easier, they focus on bullshit because more people will read and watch bullshit.

Alternatively you can link directly to the ticket-submission page from the in-game button that used to let you submit tickets without leaving the game.  Chat support is almost nonexistent and will probably refer you to ticket-submission for anything directly related to changing the in-game status of your account's items/currency/whatever.  Tickets will take anywhere from 30 minutes to a week or so, depending on the time/date of submission and how many times the CS staff miss ""do our jobs"" with the darts they throw.

You do that, and everyone around you will continue treating you like shit. Maybe one day you'll realize that you get treated like that not because of racism, but because you're an asshole, as well as a buzzkill that won't stop crying about racism and blaming your problems on everyone else.  And nice job on the classic ""you can't have an opinion about this because you're white"" mantra. Very original. I bet you grew up in some privileged area in the northeast or something, probably with wealthy parents, and like to pretend like you had it hard.

It's a 10,000lb - 30,000lb school bus with all the tires deflated. 100% of the weight pressing from the rims thru the tire. Unloaded buses can easily weigh 5-15 tons.  Many tires were probably completely destroyed. Bus/truck tires can easily run $500 each. Most buses having around 6 tires. That sort of stupidity will add up quicky.  I agree that they probably shouldn't go to prison. They should probably pay back all the damages they caused - including parents that had to miss work or hire a sitter, or lost jobs because they had to miss work. And the cost to the district to run school an extra day.  But hey, they're just kids having a laugh right? You'll find another job. You didn't need that $100 in pay today? Or that $80 in babysitting for a few kids?  Have a sense of humor!

I don't think it's funny or okay to toss around slurs against people who are so under represented and misunderstood they kill themselves rather frequently. I don't see why I am being overly touchy.

At night time when the foreman checks out and phil arrives to the plantation he begins extracting the fluid and then basks the pumpkins in their own secretions. Over the course of the night, this fluid hardens resulting in a thin lair covering the previous. As the weeks go by, the lairs begin to add up resulting in a seemingly larger pumpkin day by day. Occasionally you will notice little bubbles too, that's usually just the result oh Phil whisking the secretion fluid adding air to give it more of a base.

0,Nice,  the good old ""downgrade circlejerk"",  not as if we've beaten that horse to death enough,  eh?  I wonder when people will learn that bullshots are a thing and that as time progresses things change,  the graphics might be different but for a good reason that Only CDProject knows about,  some funny bug introduced or maybe it was to taxing for a majority of the gamers (even pc)  and catering to a minority is bad business,  heck,  even the costs of producing the assets etc was to high to be worth it.  You do know that the better the graphics,  the higher the devs cost.   Then again all gamers care for seems to be graphics,  why even bother that you get at least 100h game play with open world and interactive weather and wildlife?  It seems like a majority would prefer a simple corridor but with awesome graphics,  like The Order 1886,  that would be good according to how people reason.   Game play over graphics,  at least in my world,  download a tech demo if you want pretty but dead views.  Every part of game developing is about the money,  and it seems CDProject focused in the game play,  the world,  the quest system rather then graphics and I for one think that is a great choice..  Graphics can be modded after release quite easily,  while story and mission structure or world and AI aint that easy.   If you want a prettier game,  make it yourself then with mods or stop complaining

0,I've seen couple of people on the forum mentioning that it's something with the hovers aren't able to apply sufficient directional forces.  It's hard to say anything cuz I haven't seen your build yet, but I would assume it is a light weight build (cuz all of my hovers are heavy and I haven't seen much of this problem).  The problem is hover's force application is proportional to the weight, to prevent hovers from sending craft flying to the moon, so there are various problems when the mechanic glitches up on light hover. One of it is the inability to turn quickly because there is not enough force. Another is being randomly flinged to the sky. If you suffer from this symptoms, try adding weight to your bot...  Except then it would make your hover crawl as slow as a turtle.   Hoverblades are so overburdened with weird mechanics that are seemingly counter intuitive to each other and complicates things artificially.   But hey, Why are we even discussing these ""elitist"" mechanics, don't you know you will crush ""diversity"" with your skills? To promote Robocraft's ""diversity"", just strap 800-900 armor haphazardly on top of tank treads, you can have it whatever shape and size you like, cuz after all it's not like it matters cuz tank treads are going to hit 200 mph late game anyway. You can't have people gaining any form of advantage from building skill, that would be unfair!

What if he was a lazy, irresponsible loser who couldn't get his shit together and ""not being able to afford to go on a date"" was just the last straw on a huge pile for her? That doesn't make her a gold digger, that just means she doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone she doesn't think has any future. I mean, this guy seems so well adjusted these days, I'm sure their relationship was just golden aside from the fact that she was a gold digger.

BORatii si locuitorii zonei nu au avut nici o problema cu asta.  totusi, ca sa fim fair-play, BOR zice ca nu a cenzurat si suparat, ci locuitorii zonei au fost deranjati. Plus ca artistii, desi au aprobarea propietarului, nu au si aprobarea primariei. Normal ca aveau nevoie de aprobare de la primarie ca sa nu strice aspectul zonei. Normal! Serios. Obvious.

She's not a caster ADC so she's not super bursty but she's pretty fun, lil' yordle running around shooting everyone.  Technically Jax's secondary role is assassin. He's got a dash and can be super bursty with his W and ult passive, especially if you build AP:  21-9-0 standard AP mid masteries, I use magic pen marks, AP quints, armor seals, MR glyphs cuz I'm IP-poor. General build Sheen into Lich Bane -&gt; Revolver into Gunblade, then if you want full glass cannon (Jaxcannon) Deathcap, Sorc shoes, Nashor's, Void staff, etc. I usually get defensive items after Gunblade. Play him top or jungle. Stalker's blade and well, any enchantment works on him, devourer is probably a bad idea in this early pressure/tank meta unless your laners are doing great or you're against like Yi jungle.

0,This.   This very argument is being seriously doubted and questioned in Russia right now. Because of this Ukraine debacle the propaganda machine has taken such weird and convoluted forms it's not even funny.   If you say this stuff to a statistical Russian right now, they will refute you by saying that (a) Russia was never sided with Germany, the Poland annexation was a lie, and Russia signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact only to make sure that Germany does not attack them, thus giving them time to regroup and carry out the much needed modernization of the Red Army; and (b) you're crazy to think things would have been better under the Germans; because Germany=Nazi and Nazi=monsters who wanted to enslave the entire world. The Soviet Union liberated Europe (as Putin said a few days back ""Russia would have done it without Ukraine actually.""), and Hungary-1956 and Czechoslovakia-1968 only happened for your own good, you bloody traitors.

0,More recently the convention has been for the parties to add Life Peers to the Lords to make the chamber reflective of the result of the previous General Election.  This was part of the last attempt to reform the Lords (the one that got rid of (most of) the hereditary peers). It has lead to an ever inflating size of the Lords - this was actually meant to happen as a spur to go back and finish the job.  The Bishops are appointed by the Prime Minister - ahh that old Established Church thing!  And the remaining Hereditary Peers are elected - whenever there is a vacancy in their number - all those who would have had a seat in the previous system can stand and vote to take over the slot.  This is called Democracy

0,It should be noted that daylight saving ends November 1st this year, meaning it would only affect around 2 months of the 6 month season.   For clarification, the reason it affects churches is that if games are still starting at 1pm eastern daylight saving time and Texas doesn't observe it, games would be starting at 11am ""Texas Standard Time."" 11am is more problematic for churches than noon. That's why California is full of heathens

0,You're a fool. I'm a transplant to inner city Chicago. I've made a point of exploring the city, especially the problem areas to the south and west. Diversity and immigrants are not and never have been the problem; it's the ""I came first and I'm better!"" mentality that shunted people into closed off, economically strangled conditions. After generations of that it's totally understandable why the kids are fucked up. The south side of Chicago isn't a mess because there's something wrong with black people. It's fucked up because white people wanted to stay separated and did everything in their power to make sure that they had everything they needed to ride out the bad times, forget everyone else. So why not just keep repeating that cycle, because surely it'll work this time!!!

0,&gt;I never said I was.  It's quite obvious. You couldn't go 5 words without resorting to caps.  &gt;Actually they are completely worthless until the next election.  Opinion, not fact.  &gt; It is quite bigoted to suggest a cynical attitude towards the move can only be attributed to sexism.  In your case it can. As a cynic you believe that it was a calculated move on behalf of men, rather than believing those woman have agency and earned their success through hard work. Here's a newsflash: women are people, not tools to be used by men.  &gt;Actually I would be just as cynical. The only difference is I'd be expressing it in /r/ukpolitics rather than here.  I doubt it. But go ahead and entertain me with an explanation of how the new guy is subhuman for taking on a responsibility that someone else couldn't handle.  &gt;Do yourself a favour and not be so bigoted and close-minded as to attribute views you disagree with as sexist just because the female gender was involved in a happen-stance way.  Yeah, pointing out your dim view of women in politics totally makes me a bigot. You got me there champ. 
0,Okay. Now I'm just curious as to what dating him would actually be like. I mean, I'm sure t would be terrible. He is definitely not a nice guy. I don't even want this person as a friend... But I'm really curious as to how it would be terrible. I really shoudnt even consider dating a nice guy. What can I say? Curiosity killed the cat...  Too bad though. I'm black. And I wouldn't want to impose the trashy ghetto-ness of my upper-middle class upbringing. And my not-diverse family with white parents and an Asian sister (adopted children). Boy, am I missing out on dating this clearly high class, too quality man.    Us black people are just so uncultured. Except for him of course he has standards

A fucked up kidnapper ran a website where a bunch of other people advertised illegal services, and now she is ratting them out.  Cool. Personally, I think the torturing is more important, but Yeah. Or I guess most important is that law enforcement is cutting deals with sadist kidnappers to grab 'evil' mescaline dealers. God Bless America.

It'd be smart to then show a lawyer to make sure at least one lawyer can attest to having seen it in case it gets taken down for some reason (eg. Google wanting to steal the idea).

0,They never said the curse was solely in Dumbledore's hand. Snape had managed to trap *the decay* in the one hand for the time being.  Curses and such generally tend to hit *you*. And this curse in particular was not directed at a specific body part. *Dumbledore* was cursed. The *effect* of the curse began at the point of contact, where he put on the ring.  For a real world example, try advocating simply cutting off the ""affected area"" when someone has come down with leprosy. Yeeeeeah that'll solve the problem

0,Yeah, and as if all of these ""fat acceptance"" people caking themselves in make up, having ridiculous nails, etc. isn't vanity.   Edit: And they are definitely not jealous and cruel when they see a healthy-weight person and call them a ""skinny bitch"" or ""anorexic"". Definitely not vindictive, not like they would ever try to bring a shitstorm into someone's life over a description (i.e. obese). Or shallow when they demand a tall, fit guy.   Yeah, being but obviously you can't have any of these personality traits and be fat because fat = better than everyone else.

0,Well, we have to repay the loans to the banks.  They were nice to us to lend us their money.  We have to sell them things of value for it.  No, we cannot get out of debt.  How can you pay back principal and interest when the money for the interest has not yet been created by new loans?  Just keep taking out new loans to pay the principal and interest of the old loans and the system can keep going.  They make the money, we make the earth into products to pay them back.  Then they can buy those products with their obscene piles of money we paid them back.  It's a fair exchange.

0,""other highly informed scientists"" suggests that Guy McPherson is, in fact, a scientist. He's a former ecology professor, and is currently working as a doomsayer. He is about as intellectually honest with climate science data as Anthony Watts and the rest of the denial movement. How many other scientists are saying that humanity will be extinct by 2030? I'd put the number somewhere between zero and none.   Yes, we are causing ecological damage that is irreversible. Yes, we are in trouble. But Guy McPherson's views are toxic. He is saying that we should just give up, that we're doomed no matter what. And that, more than anything else, is why he's full of shit. Quitting doesn't help anyone. Encouraging others to quit harms any chance we have of a future. It harms any chance the biosphere has of recovery.  If you think it's all over, no matter what, then why are you here? Go have fun with what's left of your life, stop caring about the problems of civilization and the ecosystem at large. If you think you're doomed in 14 years, no matter what, then why would you waste your time thinking about it?  And how dare you tone police me

0,&gt; In one stark example, an elementary school fifth grader was arrested in an incident described by the public defender’s office as “protest related”. He received a low JDAI score and was recommended for release, but instead, was kept in juvenile jail for a night. In a statement the OPD continued: “The young boy was then brought to court in chains - hands and feet shackled - before finally being released to his parents.”  You have to start them off early, and if that means locking up a fifth-grader recommended for release then so be it. You can't allow them to grow up thinking they have some sort of right to protest.

0,sure, there are plenty of women like that, but they certainly don't account for all of them. that may be a problem you've come across that's why you're not married yet but i think that's a poor reason to say you'll *probably never* get married.  with that mindset, it almost sounds to me like your doing what other commenters are accusing women of doing - wanting ""the full package"" and being unable to find an appropriate mate because their standards are too high. you've got what you even semi-admitted is a stereotype (you called it a cliche) of what women in general want but there are plenty of women out there who aren't bought into the MTV baby-daddy culture.  so i think the article had a better angle, honestly. the article talks about how marriage is just a poor decision for men, from a strictly financial perspective. it doesn't stereotype and generalize women as being fundamentally poor partners right now, which is, in my opinion, more or less what you're doing. it looks at how much men have to lose compared to how little they gain from a marriage.  look i'm sure you've had some shitty luck and i'm sure you've run into exactly what you've described, i'm not doubting that. but making an important life choice like whether or not to get married because of cliches? my thought is that's not a great reason  edit: ok guys sure let's make this about stereotyping instead of about the actual legal discrimination at play here. sounds like a plan

In traditional sports, you're constantly reminded that they're real people everything they do is with their own body &amp; you see that on TV.  In eSports, it's easier to forget they're human when they're behind an avatar &amp; a computer.  Since everyone is on a mission to make eSports more like mainstream sports, I guess we're headed in the right direction.

0,Over time, those low wages compress down the wages for all jobs. And that is a completely neutral result... unless you want your assets to retain their value.  Australian accident: [$400,000 median net worth. US $45,000 median net worth.](http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/11/news/economy/middle-class-wealth/) Aus min wage is $16+ an hour. US is $7.25. The only difference is that Australia locked in auto increases to their minimum in 1980 at about the same time that the US killed the institutional force supporting broadly good wages.   But hey, just because those net worth numbers used to be reversed doesn't mean we should choose to think of wages as good-for-the-economy consumer demand, does it? Does it? I mean, I FEEL very superior when I argue against the poors receiving the means to life in their actual salary.

0,&gt; For instance, that transwarp (Transwarp! I have a list of issues with this) episode where after ridding in it Paris and Janeway? ""evolve"" into small mamals and have babies. &gt;.&lt;  Nope, never happened. This episode doesn't exist! 
0,Surprise, Clay with a 1.33(ish) k/d.. Doesnt happen that often

0,But what if someone poisoned the candy! 
0,That too - can't have her not believing in the **PATRIARCHY** now can we? 
0,are you making this up as you go along? first it's ""he's not technically a rapist"", then now it's a plea bargain that he said he couldn't get it up? lol give us a break. What's next? he wasn't even there or this is all coz he's black? 
0,Or just light your face to hell and back. 
0,Damn. You got ripped off.

0,don't forget that he wanted to join in but he just couldnt. too bad. 
0,Nekroz as you have to know what would be a good search to get the most optimal play.   Dragon rulers because complicated and so many options    Infernitys / ritual beasts because making a good play (not opening combo) is hard   Lightsworns because milling until you get 3 JD is hard 
0,clearly her first match 
0,you don't even have a peach. poser 
0,Funny, the point of qira'at is addressed in my link. All those scholars referenced like Ibn Arabi have agreed with out view in their books.   I guess they are all kafirs like us for not believing in the right interpretation. 
0,Got Craig's autograph last year at a Braves game.  Might be time to burn it.  
0,pointless. The human eye can only see 3 hz anyway. 
0,Lol that shit is ridiculous but the refs surely wanted to will the Cavs to a win 
0,How would they tell? 
0,Imagine, like, you play as a COMMONER in WoW and just, like, go around earning money from Hearthstone tournaments to catch a flight to the next inn. You can walk, but you're a commoner. Anything can and will kill you. Permadeath. Whatever cards you carry are gone until you recover your previous character's body with a new character.   Guards in all towns are non-hostile and you can go to Alliance or Horde towns as any race. You are factionless. You are a TCG player in an MMO world. Awesome!

0,No clutch gene 
0,Yeah, the DOJ is toothless. 
0,For real. Jedd's just heating up now, benching him would be terrible. He knocked in our only run today, saved the game yesterday with an insane defensive play (his defense has been consistently solid too btw), and his confidence levels are rising with every AB. His momentum is mounting.   Oh but wait, he grounded into a few double plays in April. FUCKING TERRIBLE BENCH HIM JEDD IS GARBAGE. 
0,Not having to worry about losing my job, being able to pay my bills, nothing major or anything.

0,But how can Equestrian feet be equal to Imperial feet if the average length of a hoof is considerably shorter than the average length of a human foot?  
0,&gt; Things aren't all that bad in the Scandinavian countries are they?  If you consider wage labour, private ownership over the means of production, and the for-profit driven market system of distribution ""not all that bad"", then I guess not.

0,I am sorry for your loss    Not 
0,What you're thinking of is cost pricing, a pricing strategy which I can't even think of examples for in luxury products. Let alone high end phones.   Or, in other terms; and the cruise control in your car shouldn't be a 1500$ option. It should only be 40, because that's what it costs to put the button in and activate the software

0,bro.. it ain't even a GPG.. Crosby almost at 2 PPG.. com'n 
0,Yes because Riot is going to implement a system where your champion is taken control of and repeats their EXACT actions...that SCREAMS healthy gameplay 
0,Everything is the fault of the patriarchy shitlord.  This means everything that is bad for men is actually doubly bad for women. 
0,Half of the Philadelphia Eagles, apparently 
0,And I think that I'm the only one that thinks this. I think I'm clever. Thanks. 
0,Don't worry guys, we've got RIVINGTON, the fucking best play-by-play caster there is at this tournament, definitely better than DoA!!   And Jatt and Deficio know how to analyze games from their respective regions way better.  I can't see any bias towards Riot casters here guys! 
0,Because the same people making these claims can't farm 2 items on a core position, so therefore clearly its impossible. 
0,Ooooooh!  I hope the Rangers don't win this one and force a Game 7.  That would be just...*terrible*.

0,And his punches are rarely effective other than landing. On two occasions manny froze Mayweather in his place. Pretty sure all of Mayweather's landed ""power"" punches still had Manny pressing forward.   I mean I guess Manny could have sat back and done nothing but then I'd question why either of them are in the ring in the first place. Only one person is allowed to do that at once.

0,You're not entirely wrong. We subsidize our water in such a way that the prices of meat and water-intensive crops don't reflect the actual cost to produce them. If we didn't subsidize water the market would probably force consumers to consume less meat.   But that would also mean less factory farming jobs, and we can't have that. 
0,No no no! 9/11 wasn't that big of a deal, idk why anyone would make a big fuss about it!

0,Lying on the Internet? Why would someone do that? 
0,Hey man if a physically and mentally disabled female child touches me I reserve my right to defend myself to the full extent to my understanding of the law that I learned on Reddit. That's why I always carry my handgun and brass knuckles.

0,Well, obviously we just need a more *ethical* crowd-funding website! 
0,The weightlifting community and similar areas of the internet have been great at resisting the SJWs infiltration and programming, and all the shaming in the world by the cunts hasn't worked.    This is their new tactic, to trick us stupid meat heads being fat lazy fucks.  Reckon its gunna work?! 
0,I'm sure being told off in class and forced to deconstruct the idea of health in front of everyone is *great* for all the students who are afraid of public speaking or have anxiety issues.

0,Ok sure, but the whole retroactive thing is scary. I understand it is a necessity. But, for me to have 100% consensual sex with a person, that person repeatedly gives consent throughout the act(s), and later thinks to themselves, ""shit I didn't want to do that (or I shouldn't have done that), so he raped me"". Now I'm a rapist and I didn't even know. That ambiguity just feels so scary.   I'm better off sleeping with someone, and then preemptively accusing them of rape. Obviously I can't be a rapist if I got raped, right?

0,I agree, it's bullshit.  Same thing has happened in the USA a couple times in recent years.  Oddly, the one time I heard about them trying but failing to fire a teacher for having done porn, it was a male teacher who had done gay porn.  He's a teacher in Florida.  Was one of the trending slide shows just this week, a whole set of folks with a porn history.  Anyway, yeah, these people are not hurting anyone, aren't breaking any laws.  I have 2 daughters, and I would not have any problem letting her teach them.  I am sure that she was not chatting porn to the kids.  They, evil fuckers that they are, went out and found it on their own and wrecked her life for fun.  Many years ago in my school, they fired a teacher because the cops raided an adult book store where folks were using a glory hole between two booths, and he was there at the book store during the raid.  We never knew if he was involved in the glory hole activities, but it didn't make any difference; the school district fired him immediately.  We kids raised hell on his behalf, signed petitions and stuff we thought might help, but it didn't help.  I don't know what's next.  Maybe they can fire all teachers with kids because their kids are proof that they . . . *gasp* . . . fucked, and we can have people who fuck teaching our kids their lessons, can we?

0,The worst part of this is that a 'price increase' isn't going to last for long.   Many small businesses, especially in food service, operate on razor-thin margins as it is. Food service is the #1 most risky business out there that doesn't involve emails from a Nigerian prince.   They can increase their prices to keep up with new government regulations, but not for long. Soon, nobody in their right mind is going to pay $20 for a loaf of bread, and this bakery will be no more.  What's worse than that is that nobody will come to fill in their shoes. Smart businesspeople don't throw good money at bad. The feds just priced you out of business, little small-timer.   Always remember that it's those evil Republicans and their big, fancy Walmarts that have turned America into a big ugly strip mall. Democrats were always there! Fighting for the little guy!

What would have happened to his children if Robert had found out what Bran saw? He couldn't take that risk. Yes, maybe Jaime doesn't care very much for his children, but I don't think he wants them to die. And if it's them or Bran... what would you do in that situation?  Cersei torments people because she likes it. Jaime has done horrible things but didn't like doing them. I don't think he took pleasure in tossing Bran.  This is what is interesting about Jaime. On the surface he looks like a tropey prince-charming-esque knight in shining armor. Dig a little deeper and you see the unsavory traits of his character. Dig even deeper and you see that he is a good person at heart.   EDIT: is there any unincestuous sex he could have had with his sister?

Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers, heavy duty axles, and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So, you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand (or better) on axle swaps, gear swaps, skid plates, locking differentials, etc, voiding warranty, or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory.

To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)?   The cause of their problems lie in two places:   The actions of a misguided community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime  And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them.   The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level.   How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies.   Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. (and I'm not saying this is how it should be, it's just how it is)

1,"On my Schalke save I'm using the same formation but retain possession short passing and work ball into box. Then against big teams and tough away games I go play narrower and exploit the flanks and against easier teams at home I go play wider. Whipped crosses, Close down More, Get stuck in on both.   I have one DLP and BBM in my home tactic and a BWM and a DLP in my away tactic. Meyer I play Attacking Mid so he contributes more to the defensive side of things. One WB on my home tactic and 1 FB and 2 FBs on my away tactic.   I had to get another good midfielder so I bought the two Romero's, bought Silva for the LB, luckily their front 4 are all great starters including the back ups so I haven't had to buy much there. "

Oh well, I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8"" but then you go back and think about it a little ""Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters, they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ... I can't come up with anything. Now that I remember it was a terrible show, fuck! It's not even a 6, the whole thing was so shitty... more like a 4!""  I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score.  Of course all of this is probably overanalyzing on **my** part but it probably went somewhat like that.

Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words.  Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep.  Waking up kind of sucks, but when I first wake up, the brain fog lifts right away.  The next today (today) I'll go to bed earlier.  That means I'll wake up in the middle of night.  Once awake, wide awake.  But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off.  Since I got more sleep, I can stay up a long time the next day.  And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed, dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening.     Memory consolidation I still wonder about.  Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less?  Is my brain processing everything faster than normal, and it just doesn't need any extra time?  In terms of time having extra hours in the day is nice.  I get more done.  And that's translated into spending more time at work.  $$$  In terms of quality, it's kind of blah.  Blah before, blah now, but I feel less here."

1,"&gt;The genders aren't being mixed by this rule, they're being unmixed. Thing is, trans people are going to make people uncomfortable regardless of which locker room they use.  Not unless they use their own pre-surgery or stick to the one they were assigned to at birth until they get surgery.  &gt;The trans person will look way more out of place under the current system. It's shown pretty universally that allowing trans people to use facilities necessary for them to live as their gender generally leads to an increase in quality of life.   But lower it for others?"

1,"When I was a youngster until I was I was in my teens, I had the same recurring figure. Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.  Now, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.  Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.  The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...  The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... Well done. I'm proud of you."" Then he walked away.  I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that.

1,Could you be a little more vague?
1,"&gt;Please stop perpetuating the myth that acceleration, rotation, or curvilinear coordinates mean you have to bring in general relativity.   Maybe this is semantics, but I think such a strong distinction is unnecessary. GR subsumes and includes everything SR contains and makes no distinction where a connection comes from, the formalism is identical. Curvature is curvature in the math even if it is sourced by proper acceleration. The concept of *generalized* relativity which includes all aspects of relativity is a perspective I've heard from other physicists many times.  For example, a frame with constant acceleration the curvature induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value and you get thermal radiation. All of this occurs on what is otherwise a true flat background and is intimately related to Hawking Radiation."

1,"As someone who just installed an AppRadio 4 (as in literally just installed it yesterday), I think it's probably a little premature to jump in.    I'm happy with the AppRadio, but I was coming from a factory radio with no Bluetooth or any other features.   I think it's too early to tell if the glitches are Pioneer/Alpine issues or if it's on Apple's end. I have little respect for the software development skills of either Pioneer or Alpine, so I'm inclined to point the finger at them. Once OEMs start installing Carplay we should have a better idea.   Speaking of OEMs, once we see Carplay in factory systems I think Carplay will start to offer more apps and features. I don't know how Carplay apps are added to existing apps or are vetted by the App store, but they're being added at a snail's pace. Based on the lack of Carplay units on the road, it's hard to blame app developers for not making their apps Carplay compatible.   Unless you have a need (I need Bluetooth for hands free), I would suggest holding off for a few months to see how this plays out."

Are you trying to memorize the scales perfectly? Are you trying to make sure each note is articulated and played correctly?  When you struggle in practice, take a moment to focus on one element of the exercise at a time. Just make sure you can play at that tempo. Then make sure you can hit the strings in the right sequence. Then fret the right notes. Then put it together. Yes it's muscle memory, but you need to figure out where the problem is one piece at a time. Take apart the toaster one part at a time to see why it won't heat up your bagel anymore."

1,"Hello guys, I would like to establish the Kingdom of Sarnor on the rp at some point (whenever I get a free character slot), but it was recently on my mind and I thought it might be good to iron out some details before that happens. So, time for the history mumbo jumbo.  We assume that the Doom of Valyria occurred around 105 BC and directly after that commenced the Century of Blood that swept through Essos. During this time, the Kingdom of Sarnor was decimated by the Dothraki, almost completely slaughtered after the Field of Crows. The Tall Men were driven back to Saath and numbered only about 20,000 after all was said and done and the Century of Blood was over. We'll say it's been about 500 or so years since this point to where the rp is now. My point is to figure out a rough estimate of the current population of Sarnor (other Dothraki raids notwithstanding and can be calculated into the total when all is sorted).   I've done three calculation for you mods to decide between.  * 5% Birth rate (A generous number and the least likely of the three, but I figured I'd throw it in) would leave the current population at 500,000 in the year 505AC * 3% Birth rate (Average, more akin to the birthrate seen in the world today) would leave the current population at 300,000 in the year 505AC * 1% Birth rate (A somewhat low number, but could be completely understandable if factoring other wars and raids into the figure) would leave the current population at 100,000 in the year 505AC  Thank you for reading this little bit! As I said before, these populations do not take into account various other raids or catastrophes that might have happened. Also, I understand this sub is about storytelling and not about hard numbers and the like, but I feel having a mod approved rough estimate of the population would only be a good thing for world building in a civilization that was once destroyed.

I like it when he's laid down and I'm squatted onto him, facing his body because then I can usually attend to him with my mouth and hands whilst he does that, haha.  "

1,"My university's grad division is causing a similar type of language requirement debacle right now.  Grad students in my field are required to complete a foreign language requirement (either via undergrad diploma, or exam in the appropriate language department).  Foreign students however, cannot use their native language (say, Korean) to fulfil this requirement, nor can they use English (which for them, is a foreign language).    So essentially, grad division is requiring students from non-English speaking countries to be trilingual.  "

1,On the 0 to 5 vs 5 to 0 thing: You could declare a variable equal to currentTime -q. Then another one equal to that -1. getAttr -t will give you the value of an attr at a certain time. So do two of those at the different times you established and subtract them from each other. If the result is positive the value is going down and vice versa. I'm writing this on my phone I hope it makes some kind of sense. I can write this out better tomorrow if you think it's the right idea.

1,"On a good day? Every few hours. On a bad day, pretty much non-stop to varying degrees.  It's a complex beast. There's a combination of ingrained responses and values that I'm actively working to overwrite, past hurts that don't really get erased by logical counterarguments, the standard battery of subclinical brainmess (self-esteem, anxiety, codependent tendencies etc.), trust issues, communication issues, jealousy, envy, fear, and a sea of unknowns and uncertainties about the future, my relationships and my own feelings, desires and hypothetical responses to new stuff I'll probably have to deal with sooner or later.  But at the end of the day, I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work.  I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best, and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting.  I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse, because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with, and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner, or to the world in general.  At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified, hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't *deny* my emotional responses, but I do try to filter them, and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them, and I don't always get it right, but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone, albeit gently, and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere. Basically aiming for honest words, pleasant demeanour and trying not to make my problems anyone else's unless I have to. It's still a bit hit-and-miss, but I think I can get it right, and I know it's worth trying."

1,"&gt; People ought to be able to bitch and moan as much as they want.  If this is a 'Freedom of Speech' principle, I'm going to throw out a simple point.  People ought to be *able* but they should not ought to be *inclined.*   'Bitching and moaning'? I think we can both tell from your simple use of terminology that it's just negativity. If it was people throwing compliments in earnest, randomly, I would consider the matter differently. But I do not see much reason in 'bitching and moaning' without seeking a *real* solution.  Bearing in mind I had only read those words as I've typed this. I'm not assuming anything of you.  &gt; The ought to be able to do that without people jumping down their throats calling them 'self entitled assholes'.  I didn't call them assholes. I'm quite careful with things like that.  I'd argued that it's self-entitled and currently I stand by it. I have provided reasons as to why I find that as the case.  &gt; It looks free because you don't pay anything to play it. But if people don't buy skins, if people don't buy champs, if people don't buy stuff, then the game can't exist.  For the record, I've spent a decent sum of money on the game. That shouldn't be relevant, but in the case that you were using a logical fallacy (argumentum ad hominem - argument against the man"") I'd like to refute it. In the case that you're making the point that it is not free, then I'd like to specify that ""Free-to-play"" refers to those who choose to play it that way.  You are right in saying that without payments, the game could not exist. Could Riot Games even exist if that were the case? Maybe, I don't know. But it is free to many people, and any new player who chooses to play now also has the choice to pay; they are not mutually inclusive options.  Same for any one player who does it now. The only time this changes is if we consider all or most players making this decision.  &gt; As such, we're entitled to say what we like about what Riot adds to the game.  You purchased what you purchased; your skins, your champions, your Rune Pages.  You do not gain entitlement through spending money. You do not gain possession of the game through spending money. You do not gain a louder voice by spending money.  Why would you? It is very ignorant to assume that Riot's on *your* or any other individual's payroll. That's why voting with your wallet is sound reasoning. Does it always get heard, though?  Of course not, because there are -- particularly in League of Legends' case, *millions* of other players making the same considerations but making different choices to you.  If you stopped paying right now, maybe they'll notice a digit or two go down. Do you think that if we both stopped paying right now, it would change their minds at all?  If I had spent £0 on this game, I would consider myself as entitled to talk about the game as I am now. The principle is that it is people's *choice* as to what they do with their money, and if they do not choose to purchase skins/chromas/Riot Points, then that is perfectly acceptable.  So, my overall point is that you *are* entitled to say what you'd like. But not only is that *not* sufficient reason to say what you'd like, but it is *not* because you 'bought' that right.  &gt; It's not being an asshole to say your mind.  Never said it was.  &gt; It's not being a douchebag to complain.  It could just be ignorance, or stupidity, or a temper, or a bad day. Could be plenty of things.  But if you think about it logically and you have a moment of self-awareness, you're not going to 'bitch' unless you thought it would change something. People 'bitch' everyday. To people they know can't resolve the situation.  Going to Reddit? Sure, that could make an impact; people do take in views from here from time to time.  But if someone is going to identify an opposing view as ""ridiculous"", then I'm inclined to identify such perspective as ignorant, in this case.  &gt; It's our right as the people who make the game what it is.  You have way too much ""consumer empowerment"" going through you right now.  &gt; And if Riot comes out with a product that I think is fucking stupid and overpriced, I'm gonna say ""Riot, that shit is stupid and overpriced. Heroes of the Storm has it for free. Make it the way I want it."".  In other words, you're self-entitled.  Which is fine. But I'd rather go about it some way like this.  ""Riot, X as a concept has a lot of potential to work, and I honestly think you can pull it off quite well. But I don't think that it's cost-efficient for many people who play League to actually buy this.   It offers Y, Z, Alpha and Beta, which is great, but there's quite a lot of room for improvement in either cost or features and I think that without it, I'm not going to find it an appropriate expense and I think that that'll be the case for a lot of potential customers, too. I mean, look at your skins and chroma packs; they do pretty well at these prices. I don't know how much work it takes for you to make X and if it *needs* to be that high, but if it can drop down in price, it'd be a much more appealing offer.""  Also, you're talking about another game whose skins can cost £10.00 by themselves the *majority* of the time. Only Ultimate skins are like that in League.   If you want to keep trying to quantify between Blizzard and Riot Games, then might I point out the Pay-to-Play *business model* that World of Warcraft has?  *And* it has micro transactions?  Blizzard / Riot Games are apples and oranges, just like MMORPGs and MOBAs or a MOBA and another MOBA. Don't try to draw comparisons, because it's not going to stand very well.

1,"&gt; The guy in the basement has no obligation to try and keep the game balanced, or stable, or in any way satisfactory for the millions of existing owners of the game.  and yet, people still want modding capabilities ingrained into the game. Since Mojang, the creator of a game that is owned by millions, said they were going to add modding ***half a decade ago***, but have yet to deliver, people looked to unofficial sources for their demands.  &gt; The guy in the basement is free to be selfish and greedy with machine resources to achieve their effects, and need not care if their mod breaks any other features of the game.  People are also free to not download crappy mods.  &gt; The guy in the basement is free to abandon his work at any time and not worry whether the game will survive into the future.  So is Mojang. They don't have to forever keep updating their game.  &gt; Mojang must take these things into account and it constrains what they can do and how they do it.  If Mojang were to add official support, and give a standard to which mods need to meet in order to effectively run in game, the modders would build their mods around that.  Doing otherwise would be like if you built a program and expected an operating system to conform to the program you made."

1,"If you're at the end of the game, you're most likely gonna need to do a another playthrough. Only a dozen or so of Rise's navigation lines are triggered during specific boss fights, and you're most likely leveled too high to pick up all navigation lines you missed. Here's some tips on how I got it:  * Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled, you'll miss many of her lines.  * You will have to use all of the characters, there's no way around it. In your next playthrough, get to the top of each dungeon, exit, switch out all your characters, and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments, and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.  * Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.  * Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.  * Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle, including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.  * You can try scanning every enemy you fight, but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway.  I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough, but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying, but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it. Do everything you can to trigger lines, and you shouldn't have a problem."

This does not make you prepared to use your gun defensively. It has almost zero bearing on how well you will fare in a real fight for your life. You need the stresses of training and the eye of a competent instructor to evaluate you and help you improve. I'm not saying you have to spend thousands of dollars at the top firearms schools in the nation, but just find a decent two day course in your area and sign up for that. It will do wonders for you. "

1,"In 5th edition, your skills (perception, deception, investigation, etc) don't use a point system to increase. The bonuses to each skill is determined by two things: your ability score (strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, wisdom, charisma) and your proficiency bonus.  Your proficiency bonus scales up as you level, and what skills it's applied to depends on your class and I think your background.  Your ability scores are generated when you make your character, and can be done by what's called the point-buy system that is outlined in the player's handbook, but a quick google search should tell you how it works, as lots of systems, such as pathfinder, and even older versions of D&amp;D use it. Alternatively you can do it old school, and take 4 six sided die, roll them all, drop the lowest die, and add the rest together  The bonus"" from the ability is usually the only number you care about, not the actual score itself, and is determined by taking the score, dividing by two and subtracting 5. So a score of 12, is a bonus of +1, but a score of 8 is a bonus of -1 (note, always round down for this, so a score of 11 is a bonus of 0)  Now for each skill you take the appropriate ability score bonus associated with it (ex wisdom for perception) and the proficiency bonus if applicable and boom, you have your total skill bonus

But if I'm at a party and being introduced to someone and they find out and do the speech, that's when it gets annoying.

1,"To be honest mods can go both ways, as they can make players easier to spot in some environments but harder to spot in other ones. For example multicam shows up more in desert maps, but hides well in forest settings.

It's why Yahoo has Mayer as CEO, it's why a legion of US corporates are headed up by sharp-looking dudes in their 50's, and it's why Apple wouldn't have been the Apple it is now without Jobs. Bald, bug-eyed Ballmer with his sweat stains and strained nerd voice wasn't going to cut it as a frontman in this hyper-self-absorbed age however good his leadership skills were.

When I was Pre-K I was taught to tie my shoes, I learned to read, etc.   What you get out of school is a combination of what you put in, what others put in, and the materials or intelligence among those involved. Case in point - I hated math at a younger age, until I found a teacher that had a disposition that nothing you could say or do could make her mad. She LOVED algebra and she loved teaching. If I had had more teachers like her in my elementary math classes, I would probably have loved math previous to her.   TL;DR - A good teacher, a good mentor, is a big deal at any age."

1,"I just bottled my dry hopped saison yesterday! Granted, I've only tasted the hydro sample, but it tasted pretty bloody magnificent. Recipe:      8.5# Belgian Pilsner     3# Flaked Rye     .5 oz Mosaic @ 30     .5 oz Motueka @ 15     1.5 oz Mosaic @ 30 min hop stand (started chiller 15 min into stand)     1 oz Motueka @ 30 min hop stand     1.5 oz Mosaic - Dry Hop 5 days     1 oz Motueka - Dry Hop 5 days     Wyeast 3711 (1L starter)       ABV: 5.4% (OG = 1.048, FG = 1.007)  The sample was super tropical fruit - lots of pineapple and mango, with some earthiness and other exotic-tasting fruit that I can't place. I'm hoping that the yeast and rye spiciness will come through a bit more, but if not it will still be damn tasty.  It obviously depends on what you're going for, but unless you want a tropical fruit bomb, I'd use one of Citra, Galaxy, or Amarillo and pair it with hops that have complementary, but not necessarily similar flavor profiles (Nelson would be good). I actually used those three hops in an IPA, and it was just a muddled fruit punch flavor. My experience in using hops with similar flavor profiles is that you have to be damn good with your hop schedules to get them to play nice together instead of becoming muddled.                      "

1,"There is a 10 day free trial that even former players can take advantage of.  Just log into your account page and there should be a button in there.  It sounds like you are a former player that already bought the game and has since discontinued your subscription.  If that is the case, then you will have no restrictions on your account.  You can even take the time to earn some platinum to use to buy CREDD with and continue your subscription that way.  Here are some tips that are mainly for new players but should be helpful to returning players as well.  http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/3485dw/general_advice_for_a_noob/cqs849b  &gt; its nice to see new nexians, so for you the same advice as al, cause these are kind of FAQ for new players:  &gt; 1 go to pve server entity on NA or jabbit on EU (the pvp servers lack population, you will find more fun with us on pve)  &gt; 2 activate hold to cast in your combat menu, press escape&gt;combat&gt;input options&gt; hold to cast  &gt; 3 join the global channels, if you are on entity :  &gt;    exile side: /chjoin lfg &gt;    dom side: /chjoin entitylfm  &gt; to talk write /1, ask anything there the community is very welcoming  &gt; 4 people tend not to use the looking for group tool, they tend to do premades so you will get faster queues if you make a group the old way, spamming in zone chat and global channels  &gt; 5 when questing the xp given are tied to the class of the quest, there are 5 classes  &gt; world story: gives the most exp, a must do quest Regional story: gives less than world story, do this ones too Zone story: gives a good chunk of exp but less than regional  &gt; task: gives the minimal xp, dont overstay in a place doing them, just do the other 3 classes of quest and move to other hubs  &gt; path quest: these dont give exp to level but to increase your path, you can come do this ones when you are level capped or do it for the sweet perks of your path for leveling (btw if you are maxed in your path these kind of quest will give xp instead)  &gt; 6 Moments of opportunity are the best dps enhancer in the game, to make one interrupt a mob when he is casting something, his hp bar will turn purple abd you will do 150% of damage (for interrupt, stun him or use abilities that say remove x interrupt armor""  &gt; 7 there is a lot of exp enhancers to make leveling fast and smooth (but the adventure is in the journey not the destination so if you want to feel the world and not rush it just dont use them)  &gt;    8% xp buff from guild     8% xp from flask (you can buy it with renown if your guild has unlocked this perk)     2% from authenticator     5-10% from house (at lvl 15 you will get your own house, visit it once a day to get a buff for leveling, it can be 5% or 10% depending on the day)     when log off leave your char into your plot, it will get rested xp (you can get more rested xp if you decorate your plot or even leave it in a fried plot who has the max decor buff)  &gt; 8 dodge a lot  &gt; 9 almost all in the UI is customizable, so you can move it to where you feel more comfortable, some people use forge UI as an addon for this, but there are addons out there for specific clases, cause well your interface changes a little between classes)  &gt; 10 there are a tons of usefull addons, i just use strikehardmeter for dps, latency meter for get a visual of the ping and LFG Board for getting groups (like the premade group finder on wow).  &gt; 11 when creating a char you can skip the first 3 levels by marking skip arkship, but if you are new i recommend not to skip it cause it will teach you some usefull things  &gt; 12 join a guild, this game its better with friends to play it and guilds give good perks  &gt; i think that cover the basic, good luck on nexus   Edit: I think I should mention that drop 5 [(Invasion:Nexus)](http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-03-12-wildstars-next-big-update-invasion-nexus/) is coming within the next two months.  You may want to wait until then to use your 10 day trial if you are unsure you are ready to get back in.

1,"Seconded on the natural food sources.  I've had good luck with apple trees (craft an apple) combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod (they only grow under trees, but grow fast).  I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up, and then filling in underneath with logs (I thinks it's prettier).  For my carnivores, I have pigs in with them.  Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure.  Or just move some in with a lasso.  And of course, all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them!  Right click with an appropriate food, and it feeds and heals them (no need for potions).  He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat.  Admittedly, I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes, maybe because of their size.  But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground.  Best of luck!"

It's just my experience, but after watching companies run from the inside, I can say I wouldn't be shocked *in the slightest* that Marvel and Disney and DC and WB have no relevant research in this area. Quite a lot of the time, the decision makers go with common knowledge"" and ""their gut"" and don't even think of it in that manner. Hell, even if they did look for that kind of research, it's very likely they don't have it just based on the fact that they have always paid so much attention to marketing this stuff to boys.   (For example, the medical field, and thus for things like dosage instructions on the back of medicine, for pretty much its entire existence ran on studies that were primarily made up of white men. It was only fairly recently that doctors - at least in the US - looked at things like diet recommendations and dosages and said ""hold up, why are we giving everyone the same instructions when there are very real differences to take into account here?"" That sort of thing happening in marketing as well isn't exactly farfetched.)  So, yes, ymmv, but as much as we'd all love these things to be logical - especially concerning business decisions, it's been my experience that it hardly ever is.

I'm not sure what you eat, but I know I had to watch my sugar and salt intake personally. Try getting involved in some sports or something active. And ironically, try not to worry about your body doing this. Try focussing on having fun if you're playing a sport and being healthy. Look at losing weight as a bonus. Taking care of yourself will make you feel 500% better, even if you don't see results. Don't worry about your body&lt;3  Come to terms with the fact that you may never develop certain parts. People's bodies vary a LOT, and some women simply don't have hips. And that's perfectly fine. I STILL don't have the bomb ass chest I dreamed of as a girl, but I play up the parts I do love. And even if you DO get those hips, if you're used to self-loathing, you'll just find something else you hate about your body. You gotta learn to love what you got and be grateful it's not as bad as it could be.  I know high school is a shitty time when you're surrounded by a lot of super skinny ladies, some of which have everything physically that you don't. But please understand that it's not just you, there are many other girls who didn't win that little lottery. And even the ones who did will get pervy stares from older men and be judged by their good looks. The grass isn't very green for either side. You've gotta learn to love who you are, because you're stuck with it. Be the best version of you that you can be. And if all fails, look forward to getting out of High School because life gets a lot more fun.

1,"He's not renaming the surface M2, it's an entirely different surface from M. M is the surface area of the part of sphere above z=1. This is however not a very nice surface area to integrate over, so we want to find a different surface area that is easier to integrate over.   First, Stokes theorem is used to get an integral over the boundary of the spheresection, which is precisely the circle at z=1. Clearly, this is also the boundary of the disk at z=1, so we can use Stokes theorem again to get the integral over this disk, which is much easier to calculate.  First of all, the n in this case is (0,0,1), so we're left with just the z-part of the vector. Second, the area of a disk is easy to calculate, so the final calculation is made a lot easier as well.  To give some physical explanation for why this is allowed. We're calculating the flux through this surface. Look at the object created by also adding the disk. Every fieldline that goes into the object, also has to come out, and since the field is pointed upwards, every line that exits through the spheresection has to enter through the disk, so the flux through the disk and the flux through the spheresection are the same."

I normally have someone dying, though sometimes I build up for suicides that don't actually happen!

1,"No. It's not so much an active dislike so much as disinterest. The texture doesn't bother me, I just find the flavourlessness undesirable.  Mild cheddar to me is like eating chocolate cake with the flavour magically removed. Why bother?  I found the paneer similarly bland. It was perfectly edible, but didn't make me desire to eat it. The seasonings applied were tasty, but could have been better applied to chicken, where they blended and complemented the flavour.   I guess it was somewhat like eating cardboard tikka. good seasoning, but the heart of it wasn't something I desire to eat.    I don't eat tofu for a couple reasons, but since it's a similar soft, mostly-flavourless blob that you just apply flavouring to, I imagine I would find it similarly undesirable.  (I eat meat, so I have no reason to turn to tofu, and I figure there are enough soy byproducts in so many other things these days that I'd just as well stay away from eating big chunks of soy. the only tofu I eat is in shelf-stable TVP ground form when backpacking, where it offers significant advantages over meat.)

1,"It sounds like you know what's best.   Btw, you likely didn't fail him. It's very normal for pits to have prey drive and it's very normal for pits to turn on"" around his age. Turning on in pit bulls is becoming dog aggressive.   My little bitch was at the dog park for 2-3 fucking hours, every single day, without fail from the day after her shots were done to about 9 months old. I took her to classes, I took her to stores, I took her everywhere. Didn't matter, little hot girl turned on at 9ish months and we had to stop dog park. She still has dog friends, but they're from her puppy stage and have established relationships. She gets on good with plenty of new dogs, but the 2% she wants to attack plus the 100% that she would never back down from and welcome a fight from meant no more dog park for the most part.   You need to make sure that these boys are extremely clear on the fact that she's got extremely strong prey drive and also dog aggression. They need to verbally confirm that they understand that they cannot own another dog or pet while he's still alive with them.   I think the fact you could go visit and also babysit is pretty cool. It's a unique opportunity that lessens the hurt of this decision.   Lastly, I hate to judge you on appearances, but you seem like the kind of girl who's priorities in life are your social and night life. This is probably just about the worst breed to own for someone like that.   Good luck with whatever you choose.

Your eyes show what you're feeling on the inside, your eyebrows show your reaction to those feelings/ what you're feeling on the outside. So if you're in a situation you're being judged, just keep them flat and don't twitch or knit your eyebrows. They move a little closer together and knit"" when you are feeling anxious or judged, but if you keep them flat or slightly arched, you appear to NOT GIVE A FUCK GANGSTER AS FUCK LIKE OCEANS.

Four remained ... and one the white wolf could no longer sense.  The quote is doubly ambiguous. Specifically this part  &gt; Four remained ... and one the white wolf could no longer sense.  The four"" can refer back to either the ""six"" or the ""five"" from the previous sentence. Already this opens the door for GW being alive. If Ghost is saying that 4 of 5 remain... then Lady is still the only dead one.  The ""one"" is also ambiguous - it may refer back to the ""four"", meaning that Ghost can't sense one of the four as you're assuming. It may also be an independent clause, meaning there is an additional one besides the four.  ---  Your reasoning that Summer can't be sensed because   &gt; powerful magic swirling about  is pretty lame. Not sure how that's supposed to convince me when the text clearly states that Ghost can sense Summer  &gt; On the other side the wind was colder still, **the wolf sensed.** That was where his brother was, **the grey brother who smelled of summer.**

The Nisha call (Adnan made sure to put Jay on the phone even though he didn't know Nisha) and short visit to Cathy's house seem like an attempt at an alibi. Adnan was back at school in time for track. Imo it all went too smoothly for it to have been unplanned.   On how close they were-I'd say they were probably just getting to know each other. Jay was older and more streetwise than Adnan, Adnan was a wannabe thug trying to impress him. Adnan flattered Jay's gangster image by asking him to help him, but I doubt Jay actually thought he'd go through with it. "

1,"Lol.  That's my comment you're talking about.  I'm a public defender.  Exposing lying cops is one of the favorite parts of my job.  Telling people they're probably shit out of luck is a pretty common response in the sub, but that's largely because there are a lot of posts that warrant that response.  I employ a similar approach with my clients:  I don't sugarcoat anything, and I focus on what we *can* do.  Sometimes this is quite a bit, other times it's not much.    I do agree with you though that snark, derision, and telling people they're wrong, happen more than necessary. Lurkers seem to upvote based on entertainment value, so judgmental replies can sometimes rise to the top.  I can definitely be guilty of some snark, but I always attempt to include helpful questions or comments alongside.  And sometimes you have to dig a bit deeper or wait around for something genuinely helpful.  [Here's a good recent example](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/33oc2p/trespassing_charges_from_an_officer_for_crossing) where the top-rated comment tells the guy he's guilty, and then the guy comes along later on to say that he successfully fought the ticket.  But I'll stand by my statement to that guy - he probably has no recourse.  That's not the feel-good response, but it's the honest one."

Battlefront II, even though the multiplayer on PC is a ghost town, is still a hell of a fun time with galactic conquest and the single player, even as it is basically bot matches.  Star Wars: Republic Commando is one of my personal favorites. It's a first person shooter about a squad of elite clone troopers undertaking dangerous missions. "

However, the average media that depicts American geographical knowledge tends to do it for humor and targets unintelligent participants for the questions to display America in a negative light. Granted, I'm sure there are actual stats saying Americans are worse at geography but most people base their views of TV shows or Youtube channels asking Americans for their geographic knowledge. If its filmed in Cali, you're cherry picking."

1,Pretty garbage it is the reason I bought a PS4 they constantly have crashing servers and what not. The reason I said I didn't know if it was coming to PC was because when it was first announced it was not I believe a petition made that possible. That being said do not be hopeful for it to be released at the same time since no release date has been set yet and ubisoft focuses on their console games first.

1,"First thanks for this, and didn't realize the tourny gives out gems too.   I was saving cards mainly for crafting/deck building seeing from your response I just need the high cards with the WWs, and the fact I can just farm the cards again I'll be dumping most of the cards.  The tournament I joined and am fluctuating between the low to mid 30s for ranking which is higher than I expected, so will be playing more of that. I lost about 20K in gold since I didn't see it cost money per search but it's so easy to come by I'm not worried.  That makes sense with Dr. Donut. There have been times I needed a certain field creature but they were either in the discard or deep in the deck. I'll start leveling him now. Then hopefully obtain Hunson at some point.   I concur on it just being a game. :) Thanks again on all this and will be making some changes now."

1,"Well you're definitely going to need the Sun's coordinates. From looking at your label and usage of linspace I guess it is at r=21.6 and whatever theta corresponds to down. From there you'll need the direction vector from the sun to each point (X_arrow - X_sun? might as well convert to Cartesian here since you'll want it in the next step), and do a dot product manually using the U, V components. Once you have the value at each, normalize them to the 0,1 range and use a cmap to set the color of each arrow.  That's the gist... Most of those things should be google-able, but let me know if you want a link to anything in particular."

I am not the most well informed, but if it had an impact it would be through a different mode of action than what I am suggesting. "

1,"As meat projectors,"" once our chemical processes shut down then we will simply be nonfunctioning matter, like a broken CD. The data might still be there but it is unretrievable and has no purpose. In such a world there is no true love or kindness, evil or hate, there are just chemicals and hormones incentivizing and compelling us to act in certain ways. Some people believe this is the truth because they think science is rational, and there is no objective proof that there is something else.  My personal opinion is the double-slit experiment proves that science as understood by humans is still mysterious, subjective, and incomplete. The study of art and humanities (and psychedelics) have probed human experience and come up with explanations far more beautiful and terrible than what science alone can offer. What's the harm in believing in that we could be experiencing something much more magical than we know?  As a species, we should encourage the marriage of science and art instead of creating a false division between the two. We must explore our spiritual capacities, in addition to the scientific laws that bind our universe. Both can be true simultaneously.   At the end of the day, believe in what brings you peace.
1,"I just got out of that industry, and these gatekeepers are called to death.  Big problem is that most fleets have a registration via the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) which keeps a publicly available database containing contact info.

The characters are not the same and first attempts to play them as so can be frustrating. Randoming really allows you to explore the physics and tactics of a totally different game.  I feel as though it helped me find characters I liked much faster including ones I never thought I'd like. Being forced to try everyone really opens your eyes to the fact that a crazy amount of characters are viable in this game and a fresh meta.   Honestly many of the fundamentals translate. Bairs are strong on almost everyone and pivoting into them really increases success. Paper scissors rock is definitely a major aspect. Forcing people into pressures decisions is where the greatest players shine. Mixing up approaches is crucial. Predictability is death no matter how fast you are. Empty hops and jabs are your friends.   TLDR: Keep an open mind and try lots of different characters/tactics until it clicks"".

1,"Pretty much what /u/Lluxx said. It doesn't help that the radical left has been getting progressively more and more radical as of late thanks to things like Tumblr and whatnot. In real life, amongst my friends and acquaintances, I would be considered pretty radical on a lot of issues, but in certain spaces here on reddit and other websites, I would very much be considered a moderate due to how far the left has moved.  Also, there's a small, but very vocal minority of people who identify as feminists or who are interested in social justice that use it as a way to bolster their own self-esteem by putting down anyone who isn't as radical as they are. A very holier-than-thou call-out culture, basically. When that's your first and main experience with feminism, it's not hard to imagine why someone would flinch at the thought of being lumped in with them and choose to identify with something else instead. I don't agree with it personally, since there's a lot more to feminism than the people bitching about nonsense on Tumblr, but I'm not surprised when people are turned off.   "

1,"It doesn't say it, but it can be inferred from the numbers easily. It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites, and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population, blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math.   There are 5814 offenders  52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number  24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number   There are 245,532,000 whites in America  There are 41,600,000 blacks in America   We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:  1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013  1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013   This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita.

1,"Necromancy is one of those things that's been codified as 'evil' because that's just the typical fantasy archetype for it, but not without good reason. As the classic alignments go, 'Evil' is considered selfish, disrespectful, and dishonorable, and necromantic magic falls into a lot of those categories. Some of the chief reasons include the following:  * General respect for the bodies of the dead. Most societies value the symbolic gesture of putting their dead to rest (which is why a lot of the time when a person dies in war or execution in other countries, they go to great lengths to get the bodies sent back home), so even if the corpse is mindless, their relatives and friends wouldn't take kindly to it. * It's considered a cheap and horrible form of psychological warfare. Imagine you're fighting a war, one of your close comrades-in-arms dies, and next thing you know they're raised as a shambling corpse trying to kill you. It might be effective but generally it'd be considered a pretty abhorrent thing to do to someone, both the person who died and their loved ones. * Depending on the game and the setting, necromantic magic (and other similar kinds of dark magics) are innately corrupting, degrading either the caster's soul or body. * On that note (and I think this is the big one), I believe under the standard PF setting, raising a corpse with necromancy anchors the soul to that body, trapping them in their shambling corpse until the undead body is slain (that's why in the Golarian setting, Pharasma, the goddess of death, abhors necromancy; because it's a perversion of the cycle and keeps souls from her realm). So the whole 'putting their soul to rest' shtick is quite literally freeing their soul from their body so they can peacefully go to the afterlife.  Obviously all this depends on the setting. It's generally codified that necromancy follows a lot of these conventions, but depending on the setting it may be considered socially acceptable, and the rules about corruption and soul-anchoring may not exist, so it's less abhorrent for the person who's body it was.  If the setting your playing in has all those conventions, however, there's not much you'll be able to do to convince other people what your doing isn't somewhat abhorrent. The act of raising dead bodies isn't going to be something you can really make anyone feel comfortable about, and all other kinds of necromantic magic is inherently about torture and suffering, so again that's not going to win you any friends.  From a player perspective, what you want to do is accept that's the case and run with it. Maybe your character is trying to prove a point that not all necromancers are evil while being ignorant to the social and technical pitfalls with it? Maybe he's just genuinely ignorant and doesn't understand why everyone looks down on him for it? Think about those things with the above info in mind."

1,"Where are you hearing this? I recall the news that it wasn't quantum"" years ago, but everything I read about simply stated that it wasn't a full quantum computer; it most certainly houses qubits, and the methodology behind it is adiabatic wavefunction collapse. I don't completely understand how that can be used for computation, but I know Google is already using it to improve their search algorithms...using methods previously developed in adiabatic quantum computing theory. So it may not be a full ""quantum computer"" by some peoples' definitions, but they do advertise that these 512 qubits *are* addressable, they do charge *ten million dollars* for the thing, and it does perform algorithms based in quantum information theory. IMHO, that makes it pretty quantum, no? (Plus read the documentation on how the thing works; Josephson Junction coupling is still very much a quantum mechanical operation...)

1,"&gt;Even the most despicable racist, has a basic right as a fundamental law of existing, to think thoughts and express them.  No. No, he doesn't.  And quit trying to deny that you're a white supremacist. It's just sad to watch you try. Why can't you be strong and proud, like you believe your great white race to be?  &gt;And when the media, politician, or celebrity spread ideas that are incorrect we should censor them too?  Um, yes? Obviously? I work in the media, and our producers are constantly fact-checking and censoring"" their content to be sure that it's factually correct before they air it. Are you fucking kidding me?   &gt;I'm pointing out that they have a line of reasoning to their beliefs.   Yes, and so does ISIS. So did the Nazis.  &gt;You haven't actually demonstrated why the FBI crime statistics don't represent the actual criminality of races  I've never denied the statistics. I've denied the conclusions that white supremacists like yourself draw from those statistics.  &gt;I do know, and it isn't because poverty is creating the numbers  That is fucking hilarious. Of course it's not JUST poverty. It's Racism and Dominance and Poverty, combined.  &gt;it is telling that you can't even do your own homework to actual disprove the claims of these people who you are so inclined to censor and think are so vile  Why do you assume that I ""haven't done my homework""? You think I just came to these conclusions by pulling them out of my ass? I used to be a fucking white supremacist myself. I did the research. I found out that I was full of shit, and so were all the poisonous people filling my mind.  I've done the fucking research. I don't need to do it FOR YOU.  I understand the concept. I find complete freedom of ALL speech to be a repugnant concept.

1,"I don't think that every movie needs to pass the bechdel test (and to this point, some have proposed the mako mori test to address what some see as deficiencies in the bechdel test).  So long as we can agree that the Bechdel test isn't a test which demonstrates whether a movie should or should not be made, but which can be used to examine movies made in a year in aggregate- it seems like a useful tool to me.  Back when we were doing the advocacy exchange project, we had a subject on the portrayal of women in popular media, and the bechdel test [featured heavily in what I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/1y3pvf/taep_mra_discussion_portrayal_of_women_in_popular/cfh4984).  I guess the TLDR is: my only criticisms of the bechdel test would be if it is proposed as an absolute metric for the worth of a movie, or presented as an infallible way to identify whether a movie depicted strong women, or if it was presented as the only way to determine if a movie treated gender fairly. "

Aren't your principles worth more than $1?  What they should have done is some combination of the following:  * Plan ahead. If struggling financially, make known publicly that continued freeness will not be possible if current trends continue, and politely request donations long in advance.  * Offer the option to remain on the current version for free without support. Of course people are not entitled to services or future updates, but they are entitled to keep what they already have.  * Develop premium features."

1,"Its simply a test range nowhere in the film does it say that its some kind of gamma bomb test range. It could be radiation. The CLOUD DID NOTHING TO BRUCE PHYSICALLY it is a mental imprint of a horrible incident on him. The only exposure he had when he was a kid was the one he was born with. The mushroom cloud is simply an incident wherein everyone was evacuated and only the base was destroyed. The reason Bruce was able to withstand the Gamma Ray burst which would have killed anyone else was because of the regenerative trait he was born with that was passed on by his father.   I think you have real issues understanding non-standard narrative devices. No one was exposed to anything in that blast other than possible radioactive drift, unless they made it out of the exclusion zone. Or it wasn't even radioactive. Mushroom clouds can be caused by all kinds of explosions.   He needed to cure his son because he never intended for his son to be a part of the experiment and he had no idea what it would do to Bruce. In the end the passed down trait saved Bruce from a Gamma Ray burst that would have surely killed him. I have no problem with them figuring out a way to make it marginally more believable why Bruce would survive that Gamma Ray burst as it would melt any person exposed to it. In fact even his friend shouldn't have survived.   You are wrong many people like the Hulk especially film enthusiasts. I understand if you just like straight forward comic films, Hulk was just different. "

1,"I have very vivid dreams every night, here are the two most common.  - I walk down the stairs into a dark basement. There is always a door at the bottom. It slowly creeks open and a giant hissing crocodile emerges. I try to scramble up the stairs and keep tripping and falling the whole way up. I finally get to the top and collapse and my legs wont work. I try to scream for help but nothing comes out, all while this croc slowly gets closer and closer. Eventually it gets to me and eats me.  - This one the context of the dream is always different except for 1 detail it always takes place in the mountains. I could be riding a bike, in the city in the middle of a car chase, or in a park with some girl I wanna bang. Then out of nowhere a giant meteorite impacts the side of a mountain nearby and huge chunk of the mountain gets blown off and flies towards me. It is always so vivid and real. So this chunk is massive and I know there is nothing I can do but just watch it fly towards me. Right before it impacts I wake up.  I forgot about a sleep paralysis dream I get. Not as common as the other 2, I get it maybe 3 times a year. I will be lying in bed and then I wake up (at least I think I do) but I cant move a single muscle. The only thing that functions is my eyes. Then a black cat with glowing eyes will jump up onto the foot of the bed start hissing at and screeching at me while it slowly crawls up my body towards my face. I will try and kick and scream but nothing works. Its much like the Crocodile dream except I can see and sense everything going on around me. my girlfriend has even been watching TV beside me while it happens and looked at me and asked whats wrong with me?"" while I stare into space not blinking or moving. And I can see her and hear her but cant respond. eventually the cat gets to my stomach, crouches low lets out a hiss and pounces at my throat. As its mid leap it just turns to smoke and disappears. The second it disappears I can move and scream, and I do every time.... The weird part is everything stays the same its like the only thing that was dream was the cat that was put into the real world that I see in front of me.

1,"In the defense of many abbathurs,  The stab has a fairly longish cooldown, and a long range. Usually it is not the distance that is the problem, but the angle, and when it is the distance it is usually by only a step or two.  When you get a shield, get a non-minion blocked angle and just take a step or two closer so the stab can fire then back off again and stay back for at least 4 seconds. It doesn't take to many stabs to get them low enough that you can 'assassinate' them with your abilities.  Spike has a shorter range than stab and a longer cool down (8 ish seconds). If you see an opening to close to half range and minions are blocking the stab dart in, let abba do a spike from behind the safety of minions then run away before the enemy can run around to you. Spike isn't minion blocked like stab is."

1,"My only UFO experience was while standing over a hill overlooking my hometown with a few of my closest friends from high school; we were all just standing there, facing the mountain and talking.  Suddenly, a HUGE ball of light with a white hot center and green rim shot across the sky, starting from the top-right corner of our vision and passed over the mountain in front of us within a second, *maybe* a second and a half. The weird thing was that it lit up the top part of the mountain it was passing over... like, a lot of it. It was real bright.  We all just sorta sat there for a second until someone piped up... uh, did anyone else see that? Agreed on color, shape, momentum. Our skeptic said it had to be a missile test from the nearby military spot but that thing was flying relatively low to the ground which is super dangerous, the base is 30 miles away, and that thing was moving CRAZY QUICK. Like, at least 5x the speed of an airplane at the same relative distance.  I also had an ex -- born, raised and practicing Catholic, never really ventured into any philosophy or other religions -- who would fall into trance and speak in really esoteric terminology. It was incredibly weird but also super fascinating. She would completely forget what she had said, wake up"" and I would be sitting there with my jaw on the floor.

1,"The comment I refer to is the one I anonimised as green.  I know this will probably generate some flak, but I feel it's worth it for it's importance.    For some context, the video was about Verdun, a PC exclusive WW1 shooter.  It's especially crucial in times like these when a console gamer admits a PC would be good to have, to be nice and helpful to them, providing cost effective builds, and overall giving a good impression, instead he got the same old troll comment putting him down for owning a different system, even calling him a peasant even though, as far as I can tell, he's no where near that.  Imagine how quickly we could have had him take an interest in PC gaming!  Maybe the first comment made by 'green' was a bit of tounge and cheek joking, but his second comment was really un-nessecary. We need to make sure we send the right message to others about who we are (e.g.  lessen the use of peasantry unless absolutely deserved), even apologising for someone's bad behaviour is good enough to ammend hard feelings.

1,"Haha, I'm trying my best to give you the benefit of the doubt but you're not making it easy.  It's not I thought Shirin's edit"". It's that the editors have repeatedly promised us of an uprising by the good people, and that the editors have deliberately made the good guys super-good, and the bad guys evil caricatures. There was plenty of film that could have made the core 6 likable or human, but they chose very actively to make them awful so that when Mike wins it will be more triumphant. The issue with that is that all of the episodes leading up to Mike's victory suck, because of the false hope manufactured by the storytelling. Compare to an actual good season like PI, where the Rupert boot wasn't handled as ""Don't worry, Rupert will pull through"", but as this incredible tragic fall of a hero. When you have a shitty bootlist, making the audience hate the bootlist as much as possible is not the way to go.

Or was it already bad when Lee came to power?  I cannot say I'm familiar with Korean politics, but I don't really think it's the parties.

Back in the day, a recolor felt like it had a lot more work put into it than just simply opening up the uncolored texture in photoshop and pressing the bucket fill"" option.  I think they are a cool idea, but Id prefer they be sold separately rather than together. Even if all 3 would cost more than the current 590 or what ever it is, Id still prefer them being liek 300 each.  Its like people on video game auctions. You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item. The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50...So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need.  Same applies here. Hell, release them separately for 300 each, and release them also as a bundle where its buy 2 get 1 free kind thing. This makes the pack price 600, while individually costing 900 total.

1,"I doubt Hinami is realistically stronger then other ghouls. Sure she has some really strong Kagune, but once Kakuja stage is reached is doesn't really matter as they basically have the same vibe of the lol look at all my kagune"". So pre-Kakuja she is probably stronger then normal, but Kakuja wise she would almost be on a level field.  Also as others have said, there is the issue of RC count. Kakuja obviously don't really have the issue of maintaining the Kakuja as they have tons of RC from cannibalizing and such, but Hinami who doesn't have so much RC stores could probably only hold it out for a short amount of time.

1,"&gt; it stops you form storing nuclear energy (though you also argued it is easy to curtail nuclear)   Which is bad financially, but curtailment is better than accepting negative exports.    &gt; that wind generates most of its power at night.  Also, it's quite active in the spring when temperatures are mild.  The less correlated with demand, the more storage is needed and the more likely it is that you will have to export that power when storage is full. "

1,"Because much of the Torah needs explanation. It's like trying to build a car without the instructions. Sure, you can put pieces of it together on your own, but eventually, you'll need explanations.   This is what Aish.com has to say on the matter:  &gt;The story is told about a fellow who applies for a job at a prestigious investment banking firm. The interviewer looks at his resume and says, I see you went to Harvard Business School. Very nice. Tell me, what year did you graduate?"" The fellow says, ""1990."" ""1990. Did you ever take any courses with Professor Stevens?"" ""Stevens? No."" ""Okay, how about Professor Phillips? He's one of the most popular professors at Harvard. Older fellow, grey hair. Did you meet him?"" ""Nope, never heard of Phillips."" ""You went to the Harvard Business School and you don't know two of the most popular professors?! I don't get it. Did you attend Harvard or not?"" ""Well, I guess I should be honest with you. I didn't actually go to Harvard. My roommate attended the Harvard Business School. He used to bring home all his notes and textbooks, and I read everything he brought home. So when he graduated, I figured I graduated, too."" The interviewer was not impressed. And our ""graduate"" didn't get the job. (Or if he did, it's one of those firms that's out of business now...) Why isn't it enough just to read the notes to be considered a Harvard graduate? Because you need to hear the lectures. The professors add so much information that the notes simply don't present a full view of the subject. If you want to get a full understanding of a text, what's the best way to find out? Ask the experts: ""What's behind this? Please explain it."" Information in the written form is, by definition, secondary and limited in scope. That's why the Oral Torah is 50 times the size of the Written Torah! (In actuality, the Oral Torah is infinite. It contains the totality of Torah, which – as the word of the infinite G-d – is by its very definition infinite.)

I hit the gym 4-5 times a week, and I either swim for an hour (I try to hit 2000 meters in a hour; I'm slow but I keep my heart rate in the 140s, which is reasonable for my age) or I play racquetball for an hour (well...we hit the ball back and forth; it keeps us moving more than if we played by the rules.)  I'm considering giving aqua aerobics a try, and possibly Zumba. Zumba appeals to me, but there's only one class a week at the gym I can make it to. Eventually I'll give it a try. Perhaps Yoga, too.  But for now...swimming is my main thing. I'm really digging it."

1,Playing it around this weekend especially Sunday will for sure get you to rank 3 or so fast. The rep literally will go by ranking you quick along with turning in your bounties.  Idk about how much time you got but if you can spend a day on this you can get all your characters to level 4 on Sunday and Monday. Let's not also forget you have to glimmer farm to be able to buy those expensive gears and weapons after you're ranked.

1,"Your observations are correct.  I do look for those subtle reinforcements because I don't want to see them.  I want to eliminate them off my list of things which are or are not possible.  I started having a thought about a year ago.   I came to the stunning realization that I'm the only thing in existence that can feel any way about me.   That didn't change that fact that outside influences had an effect on my feelings, but to really realize that was pretty important I think.  Even when others judge you, it's your feelings that make you feel what you feel.   Also, that feeling you described about feeling bad"", and ""Not worthy"", those are bang on.   Because I've realized that I feel very uncomfortable around innocence.   Around babies/children, dogs, really kind people, family....etc.  I am naturally attracted to dark things, those things interest me more than positive light things, and that's supposed to be bad and negative.    My idea of heaven is not white and bright things and perfectly clean clothing, it's carnivals and fun houses, and fast cars and tunnels that lead to alternate dimensions and entertainment (basically Earth minus the shit I don't like)....etc.   I've always wondered if that is spiritual, or psychological, or if they are one and the same.  I've heard it's kind of common to be afraid of children, but I think it's weird.   I guess i'm into some stuff that most would consider kind of shameful, and I know that if they knew they'd feel differently about me.  Only my closest friend knows about one of them, and I am very fortunate that he is alright knowing it.  The way I feel, is beyond my control though...But one can feel like a dud, when comparing themselves to the status quo or general ideas about what constitutes a good soul, or a corrupt damaged one.  it's natural I guess.

1,As a future teacher (1 more year) I've heard that one of the best places to get discouraged form teaching is the teacher's lounge. Usually because teachers go there to get away from the kids and often times complain about them. Surrounding yourself with people who don't like kids will make you not like kids. So I think it's bad for a different reason in that these teachers will begin disliking teaching more and more and will hurt students views to learning before they quit. You have to love kids and teaching otherwise you're doing a disservice to the students.

1,"It's not too confusing if you are cynical enough to believe people will be duplicitous and manipulative if given the chance.  The writer Zak"" bugged Eron to do an interview for an extended period. Eron is smart but incredibly naive - I assume this Zak guy assured him he'd write a fair article. Instead, he likely intended to trash him all along, while assuring LW he'd make her look good.  It was interesting that the Zak guy seemed to create a new twitter account to ask Eron for the interview. I googled it the other day and it seemed there was only one tweet (this is a separate account from his real twitter account).  Another interesting point in Eron's tumblr response was that he logged into his Facebook account on Zak's laptop to show him the chat logs with LW. So there's no excuse for Zak having overlooked the abuse and deceit Eron was subjected to.  This all tells me Zak is an SJW, an activist writer who intended all along to smear Eron. It's beyond my comprehension why Eron would agree to an interview after the three or four hit pieces SJW journalists did on him last Fall.

If your T450s cannot get bright I'd have Lenovo exchange it for one that works.  I have a T430, T420, T510 and a T61. The only one of these that has a terrible screen is the T420.

1,"You don't trade out a trait line, you just don't specialise in it. If a ranger traits in Marksmanship, Skirmishing and Beast Mastery, they aren't trading out Nature Magic or Wilderness Survival, they are just not specialising in those traits.  The only thing which locked you into specific specilisations rather than choosing what you want was the reveal that you only choose three trait lines to specialise in. It ended up having nothing to do with elite specialisations.  Honestly, when you look at the proposed trait lines, they are seem similar to elite specialisations anyway - longbows will build Marksmanship, Traps and Shortbows will build Skirmishing, Spirits will take Nature Magic etc. Locking down the staff to the Druid trait line seems like less of a limitation when you consider than most players running an existing weapon are heavily encouraged to trait that weapon anyway."

1,"I came out to my parents when I was 20 and for the next 10 years or so, we had off and on contact. I didn't go searching for a parental figure, but looking back, I realize that I related to many of my managers as parental figures. [I'm an engineer working in product development organizations.] Frankly, many of those managers helped me grow up. Sometimes I was sort of adopted"" a bit by my partner's parents as well.  Now I am in my 50's and a manager. I wouldn't say I play a ""parental"" role in some people's lives, but I am on the mentor side more often than on the ""being mentored"" side.  One thing I have noticed throughout my career is that there are a lot of people, straight and gay, who seem to be seeking parental approval (as I did) in vain. Unfortunately, having a messed up relationship with your parents is not exclusive to being gay/lesbian, but it sure seems more common amongst us.

1,"The Strait isn't international waters.  Its entirety is either in Oman's territorial waters, or Iran's.    It is however defined as a [Transit Passage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_passage)"" by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  There are a few other spots that also have this sort of classification, such as the Dover Strait or the Strait of Malacca.  The thing is that Iran is merely a signatory, and the United States hasn't signed that UN Convention at all-- so both sides use their status to suggest they can act abnormally.  Iran claims they can dick around if they want, and the US has warned everyone that they *will* dick around if others do.

It could have been anything honestly. I was just wondering what exactly is creepy? Sitting too close to her or something?   I didn't touch her, only shook her hand with a smile. Asked how she was and how her day was going. Said thank you for showing up. I was nice to her. I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.

If it isn't, please disregard the rest of this message and contact the moderators to get your post approved.  Cydia screenshots aren't very informative when it comes to release posts because it usually tells people nothing other than the name of the tweak and repo it is hosted on.

Thing is, just because a character can't bench press a planet, it doesn't mean that character isn't strong"".   I've also heard comments about Gohan being ""useless"", which isn't true. Gohan can become a witty character that outsmarts the enemy instead of bare brawling them to death.     &gt;No more crazy transformations   I hope so too!

1,"I am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake."

1,"Dreams where I cheat. I forget in the dream that I have a girlfriend, then emotionally cheat and start to physically cheat on them. Partway though I go oh shit what the fuck am I doing what is wrong with me"". Then, I proceed to feel awful and freak out for a few dream days. In some dreams, I tell my SO that I cheated, she is devastated, I'm feeling like I deserve to die. Then, I wake up and continue to feel awful and guilty about the dream and how convinced I was of what's happening.  I don't know why these happen. I never have cheated on anyone, and I don't plan to. I think it stems from a distrust of myself, distrust of self control, and fear of how I would react to myself if I were to cheat on someone.  I rarely dream, but when I do, it is incredibly convincing. Since I dream so little, this dream makes up a solid 5-10% of my dreams and I always wake up believing it happened, and not realizing it was a dream for a few minutes.

1,"That's an interesting Theory. Since I'm an engineer and not a theoretical particle physicist, I enjoy working with tangible objects instead of weird little matter bugs. So that kind of theoretical drive is too beyond my understanding to offer a comment to the affirmative or negative. However, it sounds plausible. If a particle was spun (enough to provide a measurable, useful change in space-time) and shot by a compact particle accelerator (or it could drift into it, who am I to judge a lazy particle?) into an energy uptake system on the other side, I can see that working. This field change would need to be modulated to provide more efficient  forward"" travel through space-time. Modulated or given an ""anti-spin"" (as I see it it my head) to cause a (to me) a necessary opposite shift in space time at the other end. Where a higher point mass might cause a contraction of space time on one end, and a higher ""anti""mass would cause an expansion. My use of anti doesn't mean I'm necessarily suggesting spinning an anti particle, because I don't know much about antimatter and the like and their properties. I just mean ""do the opposite on the other end"".  It's might be possible that doing the same thing to something else might produce expansion. It's also possible that a different method is the only way of doing that and the uptake system could power that too. Who knows.   But yeah I really like your input. I might contact you about your opinions while I do these articles. I'd also like to get drunk and have a conversation about this stuff with you. I believe that would be a good time. My brain hurts less when I think about things like this from a very specific view point for too long.

They had prepared a video to play and it was a really nice moment that resulted in a long, loud, and strong standing ovation from the entire stadium which is where the tearing up shots are from.  The only thing that kind of sucked was that afterword some fans would still boo hard when he got the ball.  They couldn't give it up for one night and respect or recognize how much Vince did for the Raptors and how he was quintessential in legitimizing the team when it started.  His number will be retired without a question."

As the other poster said LNC sadly is the most boring class before 26.  Just keep Heavy Thrust buff up and Impulse Drive spam.

Good thing I'm not stupid enough to do that. 
1,"Just that. The Rubicon is a very capable rig as far as rigs come stock, but they aren't cheap. In my opinion, if you can wait, an upgraded Sport is much more  cost efficient than a Rubi. But, atleast for me, that meant waiting while I saved for mods. My sport is now much more capable than a stock Rubi. Many individuals won't need what I have. You have to plan out what kind of capability you need and how soon you need it.  Also, don't discount a stock sport. The diffs suck, but any stock JK can do pretty well."

1,"I personally think that she is going to be just fine where she is right now.  At her age I was just fine, and I see her being treated well, so I'm pretty sure she's going to be just fine. Not to mention the few times my parents have been away she was immediately filled with separation anxiety, so it would be best if I could leave her where she is now.  Parents treat her fairly, they don't yell, they may be pretty strict at times but I don't think that necessitates removing her.  I understand what you are saying, and I thank you for your kind words and wise thoughts.  I think my little sister will be just fine if she stays with my parents. In time, she will start to clash with them in her teen years and I will be there for her.  What I need to focus on right now is me. Like it says in the OP, should I be trying to move out by the end of the school year or a month before? It looks like moving out a month before would be optimal because the social worker is talking with me *now* and getting out a month ahead of the summer vacation rush would cut down on competition for places to rent and possibly a part-time job to supplement the Youth Agreement.

1,"It wouldn't be good for the economy, but massive economic slump is a bit of a stretch.  First, the crops which get cut will be the least important ones.  Almonds are getting a lot of flak, but they're high price products and will continue being produced.  Rice and alfalfa (which can be grown in a ton of places, and are very water intensive) are the low hanging fruit for what farmers may stop producing.  Second, the commodity price of vegetables is a pretty small chunk of overall food costs.  Much more of the food budget of Americans goes into meat, packaging, transportation, and marketing than does commodity vegetables.  Third, there are substitution effects.  California produces a lot of vegetables, but lots of vegetables get grown in other places too.  For instance, green beans are primarily produced in slightly colder climates.  It's quite possible that people will eat fewer of the vegetables California specializes in, and more of some other vegetables, when the price changes."

1,Not for a decent-looking guy. College is much harder for an average schmuck to get laid due to more good-looking guys and girls looking more for masculinity along with a permissive environment.
1,"Except that this assumes our goals are opposite and our voices equal.  The tension you describe requires us to be in constant balance of forces.  If one group or voice becomes the stronger, and using that strength reinforces itself, then it becomes impossible for the tension to be maintained.  That view has a certain appeal, the ideal of symmetry is elegant and if achieved, powerful.  But it is also fragile.  At present it is best to imagine that the rope in the middle, that which we pull back and forth in our tug of war, has begun to fray.  As that takes place we separate, and worse yet, we stagnate.  Should that rope that binds us together snap entirely, we end up at war within our own nation, the very end that democracy seeks to avoid.  Whether through violent civil revolt, or the militarization of domestic police forces, the peace we sought to maintain is broken.  That's why it's impossible to get anything done.  That centre place of compromise grows thin and weak, it won't support the kind of work that needs to be done.  It also makes us vulnerable to outside changes.  The tension between workers and employers for example is a careful balance.  Introducing the concept of climate change, and the necessity of action on that front adds another rope to the pull on neither of those sides.  Workers fear for their livelihoods, and employers fear for their profits, so both pull against the greater good, attempting to strain enough to move the mountain that is reality.  In essence, this only works for the most limited of scenarios.  Perhaps it might work to encourage the poorest to pull against the richest.  But there is no centre point or common ground where reality is concerned.  It is what it is, and no amount of politics or voting or compromise will change that.  So at times reality will loom on that fringe, and we must all decide to abandon our previous arguments and tensions and move to safe ground.  If not, the floods will raise the water over our heads, and our tug of war will see only floating corpses still clinging to a now slack rope.  We have to be willing and able to vote according to our good conscience, our true wisdom and our intellects, not only according to our momentary benefit. "

1,"I doubt it would have been that extreme. Souls games already had different state-of-beings that affected not only your stats, but your movements as well (i.e. soul form, hollowing and low equipment load, heavy equipment load) aside from an aesthetically altered state-of-being, which given this studios ability to design brilliant- looking monsters, a roleplaying element was all it needed to be, perhaps with a slower moveset and adjustments to stats that would hinder/enhance certain approaches to combat. There are hundreds of different ways to make it work, and I am not buying the fact they couldn't. "

1,"It does not perform like a quad core. Hyperthreading greatly reduces time spent switching between threads. It basically eliminates any performance penalty from running 2 processing threads on 1 available core because of this, but those two threads still only get 1/2 of the CPU's attention each.  4 physical cores will double your performance (100% improvement) if all of them are busy. Hyperthreading increases performance from 0% to 30% depending on what you are doing.  That's not bad at all, and when you have only 2 cores you are quite likely to multitask and take advantage of Hyperthreading compared to the same tasks on a hyperthreaded 4 core CPU.  So this is one of the many factors that improve this CPU's performance compared to an older processor (or an AMD processor) but it unfortunately is not the same as having 4 cores-- ever "
1,All very good points. I agree that RDA probably wins again. I just have a hard time overlooking the fact that Khabib has already been out for over a year and just injured himself again.

1,"DPS means nothing in Planetside 2 unless you could guarantee that every single shot hits the target. Thus, we use TTK, and that doesn't factor in 99% of the time when flying either.  The reason Tomcats are hated is the fact that 'they take no skill to use', which, while being rather generic, is also correct. Keeping a lock while under fire causes you to die quicker, as you just have to keep it in the general area, rather than matching the manoeuvres performed by the enemy, which has the side effect of dodging enemy fire.  If you want to use a secondary other than afterburner tanks, go with the Coyotes. While they do little damage, they damage the enemy while your primary is reloading, enabling you to keep up the damage as much as possible. People will respect you far more, and will be willing to teach you and fly with you if you use Coyotes rather than Tomcats.  As for dying a lot, I really hate saying this, but get used to it. It's only been recently I've been able to begin taking on enemy aircraft in a 1v1 and win, but against any pilot who has been flying longer than me, they will easily kill me (hence why I run stealth for ambushes and getaways). It's just the way it is. 'Softening' the blow of death through Tomcats really doesn't help much, because once you get good with the nosegun/Coyotes, it's scary what you can do. But with the Tomcats your flight style never changes, you never learn anything because you're always flying the exact same way: to keep the lock.   If you want to become better whatsoever, ditch the Tomcats. It's nothing but a crutch."

1,"The other day I was talking to a younger black man and he claimed that it's impossible for black people to be racist. His reasoning was that racism means one race feeling superior to another race, and because black people have it so bad they can't possibly see themselves as superior to another race. They could be prejudiced, just not racist. A couple other black people agreed with him. "
1,"There is a huge difference between giving a shot to a person and to an animal.  First, humans have very small Subcutaneous space, as such the only injects that are given that way are generally insulin.  Give a person an injection between the skin and muscle with your average 25  or 22 gauge needle and you are asking to be punched in the face.  Human vaccines are given into a muscle as we tend to have large muscle bellies than a cat.  Prep for subcutaneous shots are also very different.  Try to tent my skin and I will punch you.  Don't tent a cats skin and you will either hit a muscle, a blood vessel or a nerve. Two of which can result in you getting bit if the person restraining isn't ready for it.    So no, injections sound the same, but can be different depending on the species.  RN's are excellent at poking people, but without instructions shouldn't be poking any other species.  "

1,"This isn't oh my God!"" terrible, but it still irks me, over a decade later.  My husband and I had our first child when we were both twenty. Not teenage parents, but we were young, broke, students.   My husband's best friend asked if he could stay the weekend with us, when our son was a little over a year old. Of course, we said sure.   He ate almost all the food in the house, and drank an entire gallon of milk. And come on... he knew we were broke, and didn't offer to replace any it. I'm not one to begrudge a guest hospitality, but the amount of food he ate at our house was a couple weeks worth of grocery budget! It hurt!

1,"I *love* Sapele, especially with a lot of ribboning in it. Outside of guitars, it's also become popular with kitchen cabinets and countertop manufacturers.  The problem with alternate"" woods like this, though, is that as companies jump on them as cheaper/more readily available, they're going to end up over-harvesting them just like they did with the ""old"" stuff. Luckily there are better environmental protections in place, but many countries where exotic woods grow also unfortunately suffer from lots of government corruption; it's *very* easy for unscrupulous wood vendors to grease the palms of the politicians and policy makers in a lot of those countries, which has historically been an issue with woods like ebony. Not only do *we* have to want sustainably harvested lumber, but we have to convince those other countries that it's in their best interest to responsibly harvest their own lumber. Because many of those countries have a high rate of poverty, they're more inclined to take bribes and look the other way, in many cases simply because they're just trying to survive.  It's a much more complicated issue than ""just don't cut too much down"". It makes navigating the waters of exotic lumber pretty tricky, especially if one wants to avoid questionably-harvested wood yet still use exotic timbers.

1,"I have been paying attention to this A LOT lately, as I am about to venture into buying on the West coast, in an area that is a designated flood zone. (on top of being in a Tsunami hazard zone) The overall opinion seems to be that the east coast and Florida/LA are the biggest risks to rising sea levels (we get Tsunamis, earthquakes) There is a lot of discussion on when the RE market will catch up to reality. Not yet, apparently, if Florida's recovery is any indication.  But as has been pointed out, FEMA's new guidelines are BRUTAL in some areas, and can even restrict how much work is done on a property (50% of the appraised value) if the property is deemed in a flood zone. That aside, I read one news story of a commercial owner that saw a jump of insurance rates from $3500 a year to $50,000 (I think it was the Gulf coast). The only thing you can do is a lot of research and weigh the risk."

I'm strong but was still developing mentally at 18, still learning the world and who I was. Uncontrollable actions, such as fits of depression and anger made my life hell. The others picked up on it. I felt like they would rather leave me behind then help my up. I was right. I have one very vivid memory that I remember every day. I was laying in my bed (separated from the other beds in the middle of the room), with my two guards"" standing watch. Yeah, I had to have at least two people within arms reach of me at all times, even while sleeping. It got that bad. One of them decided he didn't have time for this. All I did was look at him and sigh. He took my pillow from under my head and tried to suffocate me. And I just laid there. Not moving. I didn't care. It didn't last long as the other people in the room (47 people) stepped in. After the event the drill sergeant walked in, unaware of the events that had transpired moments before. He walked up to me as I was laying in bed again. He bent over me and asked my how I was. I said that I was fine and he left. It has taken me a very long time to understand how I felt about this. Turns out I was angry at myself for failing something that I set out to do. I felt like garbage for so long. It took me 5 years to admit to myself that my self directed anger and loathing ment nothing. The past is the past. There is nothing that can be done about it. But my future, my happiness needs not be influenced by past failures. I was angry at myself, and I finally learned why. And I finally forgave myself.

Kinda sad, to be honest.

Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?  As for Hate the sin.

1,I'm just trying to be upfront. I can't get a lot of the people on here to be that way. 
1,"&gt;I suspect that the counter argument is that monogamous marriage limits that possibility since it lowers the number of people with the influence to force such a marriage.   I was thinking specifically of arranged marriages, (although to be fair I didn't specify) so I'm not sure that holds up.  The coercion doesn't have to come from someone actually involved in the marriage  &gt;Another argument would be that polygamy is much harder to untangle if and when it does go bad.  I don't buy that either, but I can see why others might - you can say that it makes for somewhat more complicated divorce proceedings, but I think that the threat of complicated divorce proceedings aren't high on an abuser's list of potential threats.  Loss of economic support, loss of access to children, loss of social status - all of these are equally possible in monogamous and polygamous marriages."

1,"&gt;All that that shows is that saving humanity is preferable is preferable to not saving it. Assuming that that's not an option, prolonging the inevitable is seen as preferable to going quietly into the night.  But... then that's just straight up evil. It's the deliberate and premeditated murder of another human being(s) without even the dubious 'justification' of saving everyone else. Acknowledging that but excusing it through a utilitarian point of view opens up moral relativism, which is the ethics equivalent of saying 'well that's just *your* opinion.'  &gt;This is essential what OP wants to debate; not so much the morality of sacrificing a child from a utilitarian perspective (because any utilitarian worthy of the name is obviously going to argue that it's morally obligatory) but rather whether utilitarianism itself is moral.  And there's the rub. Utilitarianism is effectively the promotion of the necessary or lesser evil, which is *still evil.* It's a plainly amoral philosophy, and OP knows that or he wouldn't have said I know this is a utilitarian argument but..."" That  ""but"" let's you know he's about to dismiss the problems with utilitarianism. Which means he knows it's wrong but doesn't care because *results* and you can't really argue against that.

1,"Having spent another couple of days with OpenHAB I'm satisfied that it was the right way to go.  We want to have Android and iOS as the standard platforms for accessing and controlling house stuff. Kodi apps (Kore, Yatse, etc) for the media, OpenHAB for automation. Since every project (and its users) is different in significant ways, flexibility in the UI design turns out to be quite important.  With Domoticz and I was initially excited by the potential of the Lua scripting but OpenHAB has so many appealing bindings (plugins) available - bluetooth, networkhealth, TV interfaces, XBMC/Kodi...  Integrating with network monitoring apps like Cacti is important to me. OpenHAB will write its persistence data to RRDs if you want and I expect those will be pretty easy to make visible to Cacti. I have no idea how I'd get the graph data out of Domoticz short of scraping the database or manually exporting the graphs (in CSV?).  I'm still coming to terms with OpenHAB's use of Java and Xtend. The last time I did any serious work in Java was in 2002. It's matured quite a bit since (lambda syntax, whee!), so the learning curve for serious scripting is still steep.  There are a couple of tricks I've learned so far for OpenHAB UI configuration:  * Don't use Groups in the Sitemap (except as summary values). It's really tempting but just don't. Explicit is better.  * Don't bother with the Setpoint elements. They're currently very slow and user-unfriendly. Using a Selection with a mapping argument listing every possible value is actually so much more user-friendly.  [EDIT: grammar a bit]"

1,"He hasn't had a solid year since the Vezina push in 12-13 where he had a. 924 Sv%. I'd imagine the Sharks will look to draft a goalie soon, probably higher up, considering they don't have any blue chip goalie prospects, and are pretty thin there. Maybe they go after Ilya Samsonov. There's no real chance Dubnyk leaves Minnesota for San Jose, so the only free agent they could go after that would make sense would be Niece himself, but I'd imagine there might be some difficulty since they don't seem confident enough in Nemo to give him a long term deal and a bridge deal may not be enough to keep him. Perhaps they sign and trade, or look for another option via trade. Bernier or Reimer could be available. There's a chance either Hammond or Anderson leave Ottawa, depending on how the situation develops with them and Lehner. Buffalo trades goalies all the time; maybe Lindback makes a comeback and they flip him for the rebuild. That's a bit of a long shot, but he showed promise at the end of the season with them. Maybe Vancouver moves Markstrom if he continues his rebound. Maybe with Gillies joining the Flames they look to move Ramo. There's even a chance they could go after prospects like Kristers Gudlevskis, Zachary Fucale or Malcolm Subban. I'm just saying they have options, but they will likely have to give up something to get a goalie here if theyre not drafting one. "

1,"&gt; My question here is what do I do?  Had a good chuckle with the responses here. They're absolutely right of course, but you have to wonder what the responses would have been had the genders been reversed - you being a girl with him going down on you constantly, but you refusing to give him a blowjob. I'd imagine folks left &amp; right would tell you that it's your body, your choice. That you don't have to do it if you're not comfortable with it. That if he can't accept that, he'd be a jerk for forcing it on you, and that he can just walk off a cliff, and stuff of that nature.  .  There was one similar post a few months back with just this scenario. Didn't end well, but the nature of the responses were more or less expected.  .  In your case, I'd start by apologizing for being selfish, and that you're absolutely willing to go for it. Tell her you're willing to do it, but slowly. Step by step. You want to give her the best possible experience possible, so you want to do it right the first time. Then follow up on it. You don't have to go full face in, start by going down while she's wearing thin pants. Then for the next session, let her wear yogapants and such. After you get used to it, change it to underwear. Ease off the pressure, take your time, and have fun. Tossing her salad is fun. Why do you think those girls in stock pics are always smiling eating their salads? Because their man tosses it first."

Planned Parenthood is an extreme organization led by someone who is in favor of elective late term abortion, and its founder Margaret Sanger was even more extreme.   Abortion's simply not going away as an issue. Not in either of our lifetimes. Gay marriage can mostly go away, if both sides can respect each other's right to disagree.

Fraps require every step manually and cannot be prepped the same way; the most we can do w/2 blenders is try to batch blend (against the rules) or line up cups with the frap roast and/or milk in it and wait an age for a clean pitcher to open up.

In my opinion there was to an extent, although most of it was mitigated as being banks were being greedy"". This is a different situation, as the investment bank is making public its position on a huge investment issue. If they, with all of their educated employees , get it wrong, then they aren't worth much as an investment Bank are they? A loud public declaration like this is betting that they will be right, and will be able to claim kudos in the investment world for predicting the trend.    2) of course people are still investing in stocks you mutton chop. 2008 didn't change a thing about stocks being one of the best returning asset classes.

1,"Yeah... unfortunately ST205s aren't available here yet. However, since the rule is 25 years from manufacture date it's not going to be TOO long of a wait. The first ones go back to late '93 IIRC, so that translates into being legal in late 2018.  That being said there ARE a handful(I've heard 15 at this point) that made it here under dubious legality. They do sometimes come up for sale. However, you do run the risk of the feds taking notice and taking the car if you're unlucky. Personally I'm not willing to run that risk, but some are. Expect them to be quite expensive if/when they are sold.  Other things to note are that parts specific to the ST205, specifically brakes and suspension, are going to be almost completely ridiculously difficult to obtain. Engine parts shouldn't be -too- hard to find if needed, but you may have to order from overseas at some points, or at least a specialist shop that stocks parts for people who have swapped to 3rd and 4th-gen 3SGTEs.  My solution? I'm picking up a very clean '165 next week that will eventually have the entire '205 drivetrain swapped over. There's something about the fourth-gen bodystyle that just does it for me."
1,"&gt;It was playful banter, nothing sexual. I told her i was seperated (dont know why)""  *Seriously* OP? You don't know why you told someone you were flirting with that you were single? You say you don't want to tell your wife because it will hurt her and you don't want to do that. If that's true, and you really do love her, then you need to sit her down and seriously work on getting into counselling (or at the very least talking together) about fixing whatever it is that you feel is wrong with your marriage. Don't make excuses like ""oh well, we just never followed through"". You need to put *effort* in if you want to make it work.   Now, if what you *really* want is to screw around on Tinder then stop telling yourself it's just innocent banter, stop telling yourself there's nothing wrong with what you're doing. Tell your wife the truth and break it off because you aren't do her a favor by staying with her if you're going to be cheating (physically OR emotionally). I get the feeling that this is NOT what you want, and if that's the case you need to stop doing this shit and start being honest with your wife, starting with this (because it's going to be a lot worse if that chick actually does tell her)

1,"The beauty of CB is the flexibility of the weapon. Have a hammer bro? Go for tail. Have a GS? Go for head to KO. Have both? Go for feet and get trips. You can go for big hits and KOs or you can stay in in sns mode forever with a status CB. Fill whatever role the team needs and you'll be guaranteed better clear times and more broken parts. I try not to overlap because CB is very prone to tripping, but with good positioning, you can easily share a head with hammer if you really need the KO.   Also a word of caution with GPs, while there are people with the requisite skill, I tend to not use them online unless I'm in a bad spot. It's fine to try to style on the monster solo, but if I miss the GP online, I'll get hit, be in axe mode when I get out, and get hit by a follow up attack because Im too slow. Definitely carted to this many times. Most of the time after you get a GP, you should be looking to evade the next attack since monsters get so aggressive in g rank. Thus, you probably shouldn't have been there in the first place. I try to combo such that it takes me through and past the monster. For example, there's an opening head on, X+A to dash in -&gt; charge A-&gt; X+A-&gt;X+A -&gt; R to charge shield-&gt; evade forward. That should take you all the way through the monster and a good distance behind him. The side evades are great for this too. Where you finish your combo is just as important as when you start and the CB has great tools for this to make up for it's lower walk and sheath speed. Hope that helps and sorry for the long winded answer!"

One was a japanese clan who we had no way of communicating with, and the other was a clan from Spain who agreed to the deal, but switched back at the last minute.  Still 38/40 is a 95% success rate. I've never understood Jr's issues with getting compliance, as I've never had an issue with it. Even in Jr2, I am the one who created the clan, so I was there for the first war, and our enemy was more than happy to comply. But seems it's has really gone downhill since I left.   Of course, I cannot speak for all the clans, just for my own personal experience from being in 2.0, 2.5, the one war in Jr2, leading farm wars in my old clan Templar Knights"", and succesfully helping 2.4 and 2.6 get compliance from Korean clans.

Why can't I just jump back into the lobby I was originally in?  The only solution to playing this game with *any* form of expediency is to only play in invite-only sessions. If you want to do heists with your friends, just invite them to the session and when each mission is finished you just jump back together almost instantly. But to be quite honest, this is how the online should be from the start, not just for solo/invite only sessions."

1,Ballsy but deeply unstable as a Government and they'd be unable to get anything done. Minority Governments need to offer concessions for votes. The idea that the SNP will suffer if they take down Labour assumes Labour are popular in Scotland. 22% projected vote share is not popularity.   Labour will get by until a point but every vote will be on a knife edge. They'll lose a lot and only a small number are confidence and even then it would take a back bench rebellion to sink them. Maybe they'll start doing positive popular things but I won't be holding my breath.   Labour's arrogance is breathtaking.

Then later when I was using the other incline bench, halfway through my set this other guy non-verbally asked to use the bench, to which I indicated that I was still using it. He then ask can share?"". The other guy still had his stuff at the other incline bench. I said ""try lor"", but I kinda knew that I'd be rather inconvenienced by it because I don't take long breaks between sets.  Halfway through 2nd guy's first set, the first guy removed his stuff from other incline bench. So I went and got the other incline bench and used it.  Qn: What could I have done to be more alpha in this situation? I should have asked 2nd guy to go and get the other incline bench himself, methinks. And then pee on the bench.

1,"I am glad that this group notices this.  When I see this article, I sigh because it sucks this guy or group may owe this much in taxes.  I feel sick.  It is organized theft from the government and no one is really pissed about it.  And it actually kind of goes to the absurdity of our progressive personal income tax system.  Pseudo percentage based tax system.   But there are a couple of big issues with taxes.     *  First, everyone and even some dumb rich people advocate for ... higher taxes on the rich.    Why is this bad?  See my second point.     * Second, where do taxes go?  They go to the biggest pyramid scheming, mega-corporation, trillion dollar budget, war machine that is our US government.     The US federal government and its reckless spending has reached astronomical heights with zero accountability.    It is kind of shocking and people want to tax more  and give the government more money.  Really, people just want to tax the rich.  That is the goal.  It doesn't matter where the money is going.  They want the rich to have less.  Which is a pretty dumb line of thinking.  Just because you tax the rich doesn't mean you automatically gain.  If you tax Soros 7 billion, doesn't mean you get 50k in your pocket.  It is really a dumb line of thinking and completely irrational.  I hate when people on the left"" advocate for higher taxes and don't really say why.  Some might get into the debt and social security costs and all of that, but my response to that is, well what about government spending?  Why don't we NOT spend 600 billion on defense?  All that to say, I don't get mad that people evade taxes.  We should all get pissed that the government machine will take parts of your wealth.  And we don't know what Soros and these rich guys will do with the money.  They were pretty successful, they will probably invest it in another successful firm or project.

1,"&gt;In that case, why are there incursions?  I think it's because the gradual death of the multiverse via the murders of the Molecule Men is destabilizing reality.  &gt;And if Doom had been able to kill at least a thousand Molecule Men, shouldn't there be at least a thousand universes that survive?  Killing the Molecule Men doesn't save the universes I thought, I thought it killed everything in that universe  &gt;Steve says that Tony knew about it all from the beginning. How does he know this? How did Tony know?  I don't think it's that Tony knew about the origin of the incursions and all that, I thought it meant Tony knew that it was likely they would never be able to stop the incursions  &gt;And when the incursion is imminent, they're preparing for escape as if there was no hope of survival. But isn't it that between 616 and 1610, one of those universes will survive the last incursion?  I think they were basically just preparing for the worst.  After all, the one Earth they fought that actually put up a fight, they got their asses kicked until Dr. Strange went crazy (The Great Society)"

Lack of motivation, coupled with an intense hatred for themselves for being overweight, coupled with easy routes to exercise (you don't need a gym, go walk/run/do push-ups/ and just be active for a start), and I don't see why you can't do it.

However, with house-mates never keeping the kitchen clean, and not having a lot of confidence or experience cooking even basic meals, I wound up eating out ALL THE TIME. This wound up costing me way more than I saved in having no meal plan.  I suggest learning to like washing dishes, and finding 2 or 3 go-to recipes that you can make for the week.

Of course in a perfect world we wouldn't be locked into the two party system but I know so Bernie people afraid to vote third party so as not to throw away their vote"". I really think Bernie is the best compromise of this. He's a far left Green-like candidate throwing in with the Democrats so as to actually have a chance. I can respect that and will support him the whole way.  Read his website so as to see what he stands for. https://berniesanders.com/issues/  He's also the only real chance at beating Hillary too.

We're going over the human body and digestion one day and teacher decides to throw Danny an easy question out to boost him up a bit. She asks him how we get liquid into our bodies.  Danny sits there with a blank look and says I don't know"". She prompts him again by asking how he gets liquid into his body when he's thirsty. Danny replies, ""I don't know."" She is amazingly frustrated by this point and goes as far to ask ""Danny, how do you get water into your body when you're thirsty?"" and he replies, ""I don't know. Through your skin, maybe?""  She freaks out and loses her shit. He's sitting there looking dazed as always and Mrs. Teacher charges to the back of the room and grabs his arm. She pulls him out of his seat and drags him to the front of the classroom where there was a sink.  The water gets turned on and she shoves his arm into the stream and keeps yelling at him ""Through the skin?? THROUGH THE SKIN!?  How are you feeling now? Are you getting full? Are you getting enough water? YOU DRINK WATER WITH YOUR MOUTH!""  I'm nearly 40 now and I will remember that scene for the rest of my life with mixed amounts of horror and amusement.  edit: thanks for the gold!

1,"&gt;without becoming fluent in the native language before hand first but make do with everything being written in English also.  Not from experience.  They tend to have the exact system UKIP is supporting.  When I got my first French tax forms it's all in either French, French, or French.  You pay for other people to do that shit for you if you can't do it.  Somewhat even more bizarrely is the food packaging which generally has several languages on it, but they still often omit English despite it being the prevalent second language across Europe.  The exception is there was an English speaking notaire, but it's not a state sanctioned thing and there's no guarantee of it, rather one of their notaires happens to speak English too - but you have to be prepared to wait longer for an appointment.  No English speaking notaire, then you find somebody to accompany you.  The bank has an English speaking service, but again, the state isn't paying for it.  As far as the state is concerned they expect you to learn, and if you need help it's either you pay or you throw yourself at someone's mercy and hope they do you a solid.  We have the world's most popular second language, the language of international business, science, even airwaves, and an exported  culture that means it is everywhere.  There's no reason why we should be paying for translators.  And now with smartphone technology it's getting easier and easier still.  A council shouldn't be translating all its docs into 30 different languages running at 7 figure costs, and certainly not if it means that person is less likely to integrate into the wider community."

1,"Couple things. First, E-commerce site"" says pretty much nothing. Amazon is an e-commerce site; so is etsy or ebay or NewEgg. They're vastly different, enterprise-grade challenges.  Second, $5k in the LA area is not that much money. You have to figure that ""Knows what they're doing"" *starts* about a $50 an hour and ideally goes for around double that. For agencies -the walls which talent is hidden behind- easily goes for 50%-100%+ *that* amount. A $5k budget won't even show up on their radar.   The best way to save money, or to operate with a $5k budget, is to construct a ""fill in the blank"" website. This is the usual route of WordPress plus pick a theme which suits you then tweak and launch. Alternatively, of course, you could look for overseas talent at places like odesk.   For what it's worth, I regularly talk to business owners in the LA area and technical talent is always the hardest to find. While a pile of resumes is just a craigslist ad away, finding business grade developers is another story, for which there are only a handful.   I would recommend attending some of the numerous developer/designer gatherings which occur in the LA area and meeting them. You have to consider that developers in demand are choosy about their clients -they generally don't respond to craigslist- so it helps to shake hands in person and convince them you would be an awesome client. They're interviewing you just as much as you're interviewing them.

There is the big 5 though which is Marcia, Titania, Oscar, Jill and Kieran who are the best units in FE9 for the most part. I will say Zihark is pretty cool, but he isn't to great in the scheme of things in FE9. Worst unit though would probably be Rolf though if you don't count Bastian and Lucia.  Just use them to patch up the units your using or get some going. Though in FE9 people like saving all of them for the last chapter to make sure they get the transfers they want for RD. PoR isn't a hard game at all and you wont need to use them.  Yeah only 1 support between a pair per chapter.   Depends. Statistically units will be stronger if they get to 20 unpromoted. Though promoting early isn't to bad in a lot of cases. Healers are staffed locked and have pretty terrible exp gains so they will level up slowly which makes 20 unpromoted take a long time. There is also the promo bonuses which can cover for the lost of a few levels in some cases. Also the move boost that units get is pretty great and may warrant an early promotion on that alone. But it is your playstyle and you can promote whenever you feel like it."

What I can see is that the ambient_Ufos script gets loaded, which starts ambient zones get loaded two UFOs (assuming the fort one and the FIB camp one).  Those scripts show the UFOs, and do things like ensure that when you get close in a vehicle, a force is applied to push you away.  It also makes sure the special evil death ray"" audio (as they call it) gets played.  It also seems that this triggers UFO_EYE, which is the special script that has a conditional ambient zone for the 3rd UFO, the one above the mountain.  That has it's own script because it only triggers when you get close enough, and in the right conditions.  There is no ambient zone or script for the sunken UFO as it seems to be just a model and nothing more.  Unfortunately, what I have NOT seen yet is code which lets you *interact* with these UFOs.

For football, there's really just the NFL. One league, 16 games, and fans watch every one. I'd be surprised if the NFL weren't the most profitable sports league. "

1,"Dunno who's downvoting you, you clearly know more about the cap implications than I do haha. I guess I could go play on Over the Cap and see what's up. I probably will after the draft is over, just to see what other moves we might make.  As for Scandrick, I'm probably the one taking the hardest line on him. I just don't agree with holding out when you have four years left on your contract. You ain't Revis, and you picked safety over a chance at big money. Sorry you're playing well now, but if I'm playing poker, fold, and the last card would have hit my hand, I don't get to say wait, let me back in, I would have won that money.""   It's not a perfect analogy since his hard work got him here, not luck, but he ultimately placed his bet on safe money rather than on his work ethic and talent, which he clearly does have.

I HAD to watch.  My question is this:  You're given 5 billion dollars and the only stipulation is that you have to create something for TV or film that will be great. What is it?"

1,"Yeah, it comes with 10 of them in yellow. It also a cool synth because it teaches you to let go - did a patch, had fun with it, and then you reset everything to make something new. Because of this it actually encourages experimentation.   Its inability to store patches is also its main drawback as it makes for a poor stage synth - you can only use it for one sound during your performance. Even though I've seen many big name artists use original ones on stage many people people grow out"" of them and move on to more advanced digital or digitally controlled synths.   Here are some actually some cool tips for it, which also show additional capabilities of the thing: https://youtu.be/jglbXy2tN20?list=PL2Y43eupOAVWhx_1j_VdvpYArHulB0c7m  Here is an official Korg demo that shows that it also can sound smooth: https://youtu.be/fSnzCWA_JWI  Another thing to mention: You seem fairly new to this synth game. So I just wanted to point out that many times synths are being paired with reverb and delay, just like in the video you found. It gives them more body and spaciousness. If you'll find your synth sounding ""stale"" and you use an amp you can also get a Zoom MS-70CDR pedal which features decent emulations of many popular effects.  Just don't get fixed on effects pedals and shit. A proper synth can actually fake many of them. Or more like a good synth programmer can. Just focus on learning synthesis and you will achieve great results. Don't worry if you can get good or memorable sounds out of your synth at first - it will come with experience. And don't think you've reached the limits of the synth - there is always more.  PS: As an example of a latter statement, I got my hands on one of them Volca Keys synths and to me it seemed more like a toy - a very simple and limited synth. I thought: not much can be done with it. And then: https://youtu.be/0WpZZjy8MkU, https://youtu.be/__C4pICe83U and https://youtu.be/GYLRtWk9wgE.

1,"Basically if they flick instantaneously and get a headshot, and *return* their aim to where they were originally, ya gots a hacker.  And I'm talking instantaneous. Like, they're aiming somewhere, flick immediately and lock onto to someone's head in 1 frame, shoot, and return their aim in the next frame. If a sniper takes even a measureable amount of time to flick onto target, they're probably legit, solely because most hacks aren't programmed with a delay between flicking and landing a headshot.  And the spectate system in TF2 is really weird. You'll see a sniper aim very obviously below or above someone's head, but they'll get a headshot. From my understanding, this is because the server doesn't show you exactly where people are aiming when scoped, but show you a rough approximation.   Lag does come into play as well. If you see someone shoot where the target *used* to be, and they score a headshot, they're lagging a bit. (this is actually how people regularly headshot you around corners)."

1,"&gt; Honestly, I have never heard any say it.  I believe you that you haven't heard it, although I have definitely heard it.  And among the general public this is said almost constantly.  If you're looking for me to go combing through 30+ years of various politicians' speeches and remarks, I'll just be honest: I'm not doing that for the sake of a random internet discussion.  If you think it's worth digging, be my guest. [**EDIT**: although see my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34ffo5/what_one_sentence_can_someone_say_to_make_you/cqulldd) for a couple of examples that I found without trouble.]  The point is that is that it's not as if people haven't heard this message.  That message is there.  MY point is that addressing these things you list, just by themselves, are not *enough*.  And it's far more complicated than don't have kids.""  Birth control is a pretty significant factor, and on that score it's not even as simple as ""don't have sex.""   Maybe you've gotten the impression that liberals are a-okay with all those problems.  They're not, at all.  The difference is that (some) liberals recognize them as symptoms of broader issues.  And many of those broader issues are the result of long term policies which were put in place or are maintained out of racism.  That's the ""legacy"" people are always going on about.  So what's wrong with addressing those problems, too?  My concern here is that you seem to be saying those other things don't exist.   Now, our disagreement *should be* over how to address these systemic issues.  As a conservative, I'm sure you're against government programs that attempt to tackle poverty (and depending on the program, I might be too).  But I should think that you'd support means of ensuring more sensible sentencing, of reforming police departments whose behavior lead to eruptions like Baltimore and Ferguson and so on, etc.

1,"Despite what many think, the story of Civil War isn't about secret identities. Few key Marvel characters actually maintain a strict secret identity in the modern era. Many, like Cap, abandoned them years ago. The story *is* about the changing views of the audience, traditional superhero characters and stories versus modern tastes and sensibilities.  Prior to the Standford incident, superheroes were largely unofficially recognized by local, state, or federal government. Vigilantism is technically illegal, especially in a manner most superheroes (be they Marvel or DC) carry themselves. And they also commit crimes like assault, battery, and even criminal confinement.  We the audience and many people in the stories accept this as part of superheroics. Cops let the behavior slide because it is seen as a benefit to society. But the Stanford incident changed perception of this behavior in the Marvel U.  Tony understood the changing political climate and predicted that the populace would not tolerate traditional superheroics any longer. His support and leadership of the Registration Act was the logical evolution of heroes in this new world. It would allow heroes to do what they do best, but in an official capacity the people they claim to want to protect approve of. It was a necessary change that had to happen.  Cap, however, stood against it as a matter of personal rights and freedoms being attacked. That traditional ways were working just fine and one incident should not change this. His realization and surrender at the end of the story is rooted in how he finally realized that he was wrong. That he and his supporters were being rather selfish in their war.  Tony fought for change and the desires of the people. Cap and his team were fighting against change for their own selfish views and wants. The needs of the many versus the needs of the few.  Of course, the resulting infighting and chaos proved to be the end goal of the Skrull faction who wanted to weaken the bonds of the superhero community in order to successfully invade and conquer Earth. But this hardly changes the personal views of characters like Tony and Steve."

1,"&gt; I don't want to hear about gender inequality among the wealthy elite.  followed by &gt; So this is golden, absolutely golden. This comment right here is a treasure of unseen proportions, and the upvote count is a wonderful representation of reddit. Why? Because if this situation were reversed - women CEOs being paid 68c on the dollar compared to their male counterparts, everybody would be yapping on about gender inequality and how it's still unfair that they get paid less. I'm baffled.  Edit: The point of this post was to show Reddit's dichotomy, I have no idea if the claim being made in the original article is any more valid or invalid than the reverse claim that women make 77c on the dollar.  It certainly seems that the sample size of women is much smaller (obviously due to the lack of female CEOs) which could mean that outliers are influencing the average more, but again, my point was to show how hypocritical the top comment was."

Beckoning Light is a pretty good card in the deck, as are any cards that let you get Knight back in hand.

From that I saw a cliche shut-in talking to his computer bug. But then I actually kept watching. &gt;  &gt; I struggled through the first five episodes. I found the characters unoriginal and boring. But then a certain side-story-flashback-thing occupied episode six and seven. I was like, Oh, it's that anime!"" And then episode eight happened. At first I was so, and I mean SOOOOOO, confused. But then I thought about it a bit, and it wasn't that confusing anymore. &gt;  &gt; **Story: 9**  &gt; The story gets a 9 because it was original-er than I expected, and I didn't have low expectations. The reason it didn't get a 10 is because it was so rushed and confusing. &gt;  &gt; **Art: 9**  &gt; The art also deserves a 10, but the reason it didn't get it was because it's kind of a particular art style.

1,"Amiibos are physical figurines that you can [buy from retail stores](https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo).  On the title screen of Hyrule Warriors, you can place an Amiibo on the bottom-left corner of your Wii U Game Pad to receive a free gift. You can scan up to 5 Amiibos per day.  * Link Amiibo / Toon Link Amiibo: Unlocks Link’s Spinner weapon. Subsequent uses will give you a Link weapon with 3+ stars. * Zelda Amiibo: Gives you a Zelda weapon with 3+ stars. * Sheik Amiibo: Gives you a Sheik weapon with 3+ stars. * Ganondorf Amiibo: Unknown as of this date, but presumably, it should give you a Ganondorf weapon with 3+ stars. * Other Amiibos: Gives you Rupees, Materials, or a random weapon.  Normally, the Zelda-related Amiibos will grant you a rank 3 weapon for that specific character. However, Amiibos cannot grant you weapons you have not unlocked. For example, if you have a Sheik Amiibo, and you’ve only unlocked Sheik’s rank 2 weapon (Typhoon Harp), you will only receive Typhoon Harps from your Sheik Amiibo. You must unlock Sheik’s rank 3 weapon (Triforce Harp) from the Adventure Map before your Sheik Amiibo can give you Triforce Harps.  And if you haven’t unlocked Zelda, Sheik, or Ganondorf as characters, their corresponding Amiibos will give you a random prize as if they were a normal Amiibo.  You receive an ingame Medal for scanning 100 Amiibos called the Amiibo Warriors Medal."

The MINI represents a nice balance between driver's car and economy car considering the supercharger, brilliant steering feel, racing competitiveness, and passable fuel efficiency. I also work on my own car and like to tinker, so the car is relatively cheap to maintain and relatively cheap to modify for a bit more power. In the end, I couldn't be happier even though I spent a few extra bucks, but recognize that this was a worthwhile trade off for me whereas it may not have been for others with different skill sets and interests.  That said, I have always driven enthusiast cars bought used that were well maintained. I usually drive them for a year or so and then sell them. I typically break even on the sale price and generally spend very little money on depreciation for this reason. This has worked pretty well for me, but I admittedly have a little bit of an eye for these things."

The MSI Z97 PC Mate is a great choice for single GPU (the 4x second slot will do Crossfire, it's not ideal, but it cannot do SLI) - very good capability for the price, particularly after the $40 off.  That would shave $60 off your build.  I'd also consider a cheap liquid cooler instead of a fan unit - you can pick up 120mm/140mm units for around $40 AR fairly frequently.  If you're not overclocking and want to save, the stock cooler will probably be fine, if you're overclocking it might be nice to move up."

1,"Well according to [this polling data](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx), the desire to have kids hasn't changed all that much in recent years.  I'd wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth.  Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually.  When you reach adulthood, you see all the people that don't want kids because they aren't actively avoiding you anymore.  That could account for some of the perceived change.  "

1,"It's called out-group homogeneity bias: you see the uniqueness of those in your group, but not that of those outside of your group. Almost all people commit this fallacy and it's certainly not limited to white people or even the issue of race.  The USA has 50 states which are very different and we can see that, but Europe is just Europe to us.  Reddit has many different subreddits and we know that, but Tumblr is just Tumblr.  My favorite music style has many different, unique artists, but everyone else's is all the same.  Etc."

I really like games like Harvest Moon and I heard Animal Crossing is really similar.  Plus I'd like to see how convenient digital titles. A few of my friends converted to digital for it's convenient-ness and I was wondering if I should do the same.  Thanks for the giveaway man!"

1,"I like the concept of roleplay/daydream/characterplay a lot. That way  I can kind of act out some of the abuse that occurred to me and then release it. I have a stuffed animal that I talk to. In a way, this stuffed animal has always been a surrogate parent. It's one of the few things I've always had from my childhood. This animal I think, embodies the things that I never had. I also sometimes go into character in games with characters that represent the ways I've suffered. Either they have no parents, or abusive parents, or they have some kind of physical scars to represent the abuse they suffered at the hands of their guardians, or their only friend is an animal or they talk to animals better than people. Since one of my main problems is eye-related (from the fact I never had eye surgery as a child because my parents are so cheap - its called amplyopia and stigmatism as well as I have a lot of floaters from the stress- imagine lots of different sized grains always floating in front of your vision) one of my characters is half-blind...it sort of helps me embody it I think. Like gravestones are markers, my characters are too."

1,"I think you can safely purchase most of your larger items like cribs, dressers, car seat if your family hasn't already talked of gifting you those things.   If someone does throw you a shower you could add some large bonus items like a stroller or glider, things you may not need immediately but would be nice along with all the little things baby needs (clothes, diapers, toys, etc).  I feel like having the physical nursery done asap is important to me but the diaper creams and toys can wait for a shower.   I should add that they may want to throw a shower once baby is born to meet your little person since you're a decent distance away. Maybe slide it into casual conversation that Your family has been asking for registry items or something and throw in that they are getting a few small things and see if your friends bite. "

1,"Mostly right, few minor clarifications.  Most asphalt roads don't have concrete underneath, BOC (Bituminous over concrete) is actually kinda rare, and nearly always a retrofit to an in place concrete road in need to work, as it is far cheaper than a full reconstruct or concrete overlay.  Decisions on pavement structure are actually super complicated.  Anyway the base of most roadways is aggregate, aggregate is actuality a really strong material in thick enough layers.    Another repair that can be used is mud jacking.  A hole is drilled through the pavement down to the cavity under the pavement.  Grout is pumped into the voids repairing the structure.  The pavement can then be patched and a overlay to improve the ride.    Pavement repair in general is actually pretty complicated and constantly evolving field.    Pavements are not really my field, but I studied it enough in school and work with pavement engineers (I deal with getting the cars arround on the pavement), so I've picked up a few things.  "

1,"I use extra virgin olive oil and have had wonderful results with it.  I generally massage it in and then let it sit for 20 minutes with a shower cap on.  I smell like a well-dressed salad until I rinse it out, but damn, does my hair get silky smooth!  (For shampoo and conditioner, I use the aveeno sulfate-free ones.  I use the conditioner only after the oil, but both on days I don't do oil.) And, with the oil it goes into these perfect and well-defined ringlets instead of a wavy, frizzy blob.  I don't take the time often, but when I do it's well worth it.  I have heard good things about coconut oil for hair but have never tried it myself.    I have heard of hair texture changing as you age, but going from straight to curly must be a huge adjustment.  My sister's is doing that a bit; she's gone from straight to increasing waviness in the past 3 or 4 years (she's 35 now) even though she's let it get longer and longer.    Bodies, eh? :S"

1,Who gave him that diagnosis? Usually diagnosis takes a few referrals and seeing a developmental pediatrician and gathering information from lots of sources so the diagnosis shouldn't be a complete surprise by that point.  It is a bit concerning how your diagnosis seems to have come about. You may want to get a second opinion or make sure that you sit down together with a specialist and really talk through the diagnosis. It shouldn't be one appt with one parent.

It's the first sheet we've had of it so we're still testing the waters.  We also have another print we'll be putting to market in the next week as well, and we'll be going with whichever of the two has the most consisitently good reviews. (The new print is the Snowflake Buddha print which was popular back on Evolution before the I-Ching came along, it'll be going live once Agora is back online after this yet-another-outage)  In the meantime while Agora is having issues you can find us on Black Bank, where the listings for the new Snowflake print are up and running already. =)"

1,"You got legitimate points, but I don't agree with your conclusion of what our reaction should be.  It is not guilt tripping or taking for granted to be our obligation. That's only if we want to interpret it that way.  The point is to realize that we are all small players under a bigger power. Even if we have beef with each other, it will be against our interests to not align and at least provide some minimal support. Normal rules of reciprocating revenge does make sense here. Normally, when someone is bad towards us, we will be bad towards them. But that's only for a game with equal players. Now is a game with skewed players, so the reciprocating revenge rules should be suspended or applied less.  Even if it doesn't instantaneously benefit us, an unexpected support will benefit us more because it won't cost us anything, it will generate positive value for someone else who have some set of interests aligned with us, so that we might get a return somewhere down the line. With more of these exchange, we might establish a symbiotic group relationship that will make us both stronger and equalize the game for us."

1,"&gt;We are debating if what the media is calling rape"" in this video, is actually rape.  Uh, no? Sometimes people simplify what they say to save time. No one is saying that virtual rape is the exact same as regular rape.  &gt;You can't honestly say that this is rape...  &gt;Tieing real world rape to this is insulting on many levels to many people.  I literally never did that. You've said that the stuff in game is fine for reasons which are absolutely horrible. Reasons which would make real rape okay. Your reasons either apply to both, or neither. Pick one.  &gt;in all of the stupid news video, you don't see any penetration, just the implication of penetration, so there is more evidence to it not being rape.  You realize that's only because the models don't have genitalia right? The people doing this stuff would still gladly do it if there were genitals on the models. Hell, they'd probably do it far more often if they did.

1,"It's an exercise in semantics showing that you can't say that the average player in league X makes the average wage in league X. That's what OP said, and that's what I've been refuting.  More broadly, talking about averages with a set like salaries is only useful at the collective level, and largely meaningless at the level of individuals.  Try this on: The average salary in MLS is higher than the J-League, but the average J-league player earns more than the average MLS player.  Can that be true?  Yes, and I think it actually *is* true. DPs in MLS skew the average up, so while the average in MLS might be higher than the J-League, the median in the J-League might be higher than MLS.   If you're a player with a choice of one or the other, and you care about getting a higher wage, which do you chose?"

In this sense, your point is reinforced as category and storm surge heights are not perfectly correlated."

1,"Britain is rebuilding it's empire using covert agents from within Government.  Is a statement, you probably disagree.  In a debate it'd be my job to convince you. By stating my opinion I am not convincing you unless you share my perspective, as stated I didn't share it. I wanted his sources which allowed him to come to his conclusion so I can re-evaluate myself.  The danger of having to do your own research based on the opinions of others is your own inherent bias effecting how you respond to it. The evidence which convinced them should help convince or at the very least self-question.  Another danger is my opinion, a part of me, something which Google knows about so if the thing is up for debate I will receive sources I WANT, not the sources I should find.  And finally, the reason I prefer getting a source is the additional depth. We have opinions on facts, regardless of their absoluteness we all have different opinions many of which are far too long on complex to type out, by posting the sources and further reading if a replier is truly interested in debate they can see my expanded viewpoint easily with a well researched backing to better explain why I feel this way.  For example.  I believe 9/11 was an inside job.  Now firstly, if you Googled that you'd get a miriad of different websites claiming different things with different sources and more importantly a casm of differing definitions of inside job and to the extent and level. Now you could find backing up, but you're opinion wouldn't change because of the variety and your own personal bias which already knows such a thing exsists.  Now if I where to state my opinion in-depth with facts and sources backing up that exact position you'd get a better picture of my perspective allowing you to participate in a debate in which we can convey our own conclusions and the underlying evidence behind them. Hopefully with one of us changing their perspective.  If you did your own personal research you'd find plenty of sources but highly doubt you'd come to the same conclusion and certainly wouldn't change your perspective.  SO I want you to discredit my first statement about Britain rebuilding an empire. You can't provide your source and you must research mine.   "

1,"OK..sry I have to make my reply quick because I have company coming.  **1st point: I agree. MLS players are not valued a high as others and the global market reflects that. What I took from the Twitter post was less about global market value, and more about how much money a team was willing/allowed to invest in players. ** That's really what drives the global market too right? As Barca, Real Madrid, Man U, Bayern, etc. battle it out for a GREAT player, his price will rise.   So if a MLS team was willing/allowed to invest more money into its players, they could have more players with a higher perceived value (like what if the All-Star team was a team). The hope being that this would improve their overall quality and depth.   **Tangent**: I'm not against this, I do worry that it would unbalance the teams and make the league less enjoyable overall, but that's just based on my personal viewing preference. But it would help in some of these international competitions...  **2nd point**: Yes. Higher salaries like those of CEOs and DPs will always naturally skew a figure higher when talking about Averages and it should always be questioned when someone presents you with such a figure. "

Allah will Question us all and based on our deeds and who we are, we will be rewarded or punished. I'm not a scholar, and I don't know much, but I know we are responsible for our lives. What you do is between you and Allah. I have no right to ask you why, or day you'll be punished for it, when in fact Allah may very well find something He likes in you.

1,"I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, but I think *Isma* is giving an accurate account of her faith.   Under Catholicism you can't just say something is so because *you* think it is so.    If you take it out of the *gay marriage* context, I think you will understand and maybe even appreciate Catholic sentiment.  As an example, the Parliament of England by [Act of Supremacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy) declared Henry VIII head of the Church of England.  I think most people probably already know the story, and how it was just a ploy to allow Henry to annul his marriage with Catherine so he could marry Anne Boleyn.  *Saint* Thomas More was canonized (at least partly) because he would not take the Oath of Supremacy, believing Parliament had no jurisdiction over issues which were God's alone.  More said,  no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality."" He was beheaded.  The significance is that secular authority has no power over spiritual authority.

1,"&gt; how is it that the German car manufacturers there have been so slow to go electric?  They probably know the German market.  My first guess is the population density in Germany compared to the US. It's 226 per km² or 583 per square mile in contrast to 34.2 per km² (88.6 per square mile) in the US. As a consequence, most people live in urban environments, ie. flats. It's hard to put solar on your roof when you don't own the roof. Charging at home becomes a problem when your car has no fixed parking space.  My second guess is the vacation culture. Our annual vacations are kind of a big deal here where tons of people drive down to Italy, or Spain in the summer. Many of them use their own car. This is important for them, so range anxiety might be higher than in the US.  My third guess is an established car nut culture. There was once a test of car dealers with researchers pretending to be potential buyers asking for hybrids or electric cars. In the better cases, the sales men were ignorant. In the worst cases, they spread lies and falsehoods. Also, journalists in established magazine like Auto Motor Sport are sometimes skeptical about electric cars, to put it mildly.  Finally, from my personal point of view, the Model S may look awesome from the outside, but the interior is a bit too much like a US car, and these do not have have a very good reputation here.  So, hybrids are currently a better bet for car makers. "

The only kind of person who really doesn't need a say in this is someone who doesn't play games. This is a gaming-only problem. They can have a say if they want but it's going to be completely uninformed (unless they inexplicably read gaming sites/magazines despite not playing games). Anyone who plays games though should have every bit the same chance as anyone else in gaming to have their opinion judged by its merits and not because they don't meet arbitrary standards of being a 'modding community member'.   Edit: I should clarify, I'm not saying being someone who plays games means you will undoubtedly be informed of the situation but at least concerns about it would be valid compared to concerns from someone who has absolutely zero stake in it because they don't play games and the situation is not posed to present any change to any systems outside of games.  &gt; Or things like mods always have been free and should be free!"" which is likely because they themselves don't want to pay for them.   Which is a valid opinion. The fact that you're treating it like it's not is pretty disturbing. Almost as disturbing as implying that not rating or donating makes them 'not part of the community'.   &gt;As for Valve's reasoning for pursuing this possibility, neither you nor I know that, and to credit it to the dude that clicked the ""download"" link on a couple pages on Nexus Mods seems overly generous in my opinion.  Economics 101. If it didn't look like a viable and highly profitable venture then a company like Valve wouldn't be touching it. Seeing the number of downloads and attaching a dollar sign to it is the catalyst for things like paid mods happening. You think their exorbitantly high cut was just to cover server and hosting costs? Hell no, they saw great potential for profit because modding is a populous and thriving community.

1,"&gt; Meanwhile the young kids going to school are learning a million and a half ProTools shortcuts only to google their idols online and find they mix everything on tape because it sounds better"".      Can confirm. Currently working on PT certifications at school. I feel like I'm paying a shit load of money just to learn stupid key commands.  That being said, I'm in the minority of people at my school who are digital fans. Everyone gets all googley eyes over the tape machines and old analog gear.      &gt;""There's no fucking difference between your LA-2 and a plugin. Engineers have modeled WAY more complicated shit than that. Get over yourself""      This pleases me to no end. I have no problem saying it. The teachers at my school were confused and shocked when I told them I refuse to do my projects on an MTR-90 when I can use a PT-HD rig. I know how to use a tape machine, cool...I will probably NEVER use one in the real world, especially considering all the studios I've seen here use ProTools, so I need to practice with what I'm going to use.    I've never understood the old school analog hype (vinyl included). It blows my mind when artists think they're better than god because they pushed their EDM tracks from FL through a tape machine like it's some magical ""sound-good"" box that is going to somehow change a square wave through an LFO into butter.

I think what you mean is that the amount of suffering could be plotted along a continuum, but this gets quite complicated as we all can struggle at times when deciding which harm is worse than others. Took me a while to understand your last sentence. You're saying that not only should [we] make the choice to eat the best thing possible at present, but we can also seek the best. Yep that's fair, I didn't mean to imply that your framework didn't support constant improvement, I only meant to point out that it's unlikely in this economy (dominated by capitalism) that say grain production will ever evolve to be farmed veganically if we stop eating it all together and get our calories form say honey (ignore the details of the simplification).  But I think my point still stands that under your framework you are obliged to find and locate the best minimal set (can include variety as long as they are of the same level) of nutritionally complete calorie sources and only consume that.  Doesn't really seem that practical as each local[e] will have a different set depending on which crops they can grow etc. There will also be differing opinions about what's healthy. That's why veganism isn't just a philosophy, political statement, but also comes with guidelines to make it easy to follow practically. We simply can't have a cohesive baseline under your framework, imagine how much dissent there would be at a potluck. :P"

1,"I got this sump as part of a good deal for a few tanks and stands from a friend who couldn't keep them anymore.    It has got a small protein skimmer (big enough for my tank) built in.  I'm torn between setting up a 37g reef using this sump tank (If I can ever find a replacement tank that fits this stand…) and just getting one of the 29g biocubes where everything is contained in the back of the tank.  Obviously the biocube sounds a lot easier, but I don't mind some extra work.  Hell, I already own the sump tank, so I'd really like to use it because I know they aren't exactly cheap and I don't want to waste it.  Of course I could just save it for when I have room for a bigger tank...    My options for my first reef tank are pretty much the following:  1) buy new glass, a pump, bio media, and plumbing for the sump.  (I'd love a bigger tank but a 29-40g would be about all I can fit in my apartment.)  or  2) just go for the 29g biocube where all of the filtration is built in.  It will cost close to the same to go either way.  I just can't decide if it's worth trying to make what I already have work or just doing with something entirely different.  I'll admit I'm very new to saltwater and reef keeping.  I've always been a freshwater guy.  Will i significantly benefit from using the sump in my setup if I'm willing to put in the work to make sure everything is proper?"

Unless the tires you have are relatively new in wear, it's recommended that you replace minimum two tires, and put them on the front for a front wheel drive. Sure, you can get away with less, but it's not safe if there's a significant difference in wear.  As for where, I always get my tires from Discount Tire. They have a good selection, can get others they don't have in stock, and you can get a final price without any surprise add ons. In my area, they have four tires in stock that size, one of the brands being a Kumho for $50 each."

I've never driven drunk but I'll admit I've driven around on LSD and shrooms before. I expect some hate for that, and while I'm not justifying it, I will say driving abilities are less  impaired on LSD or shrooms than while drunk. (But still impaired, and more so for some than others)"

1,"&gt; On the other hand I would like to point out an aspect about this story and its relation to time. Does it have to refer to the state of beings way back then?  Joseph Campbell exposed me to this very idea: that the Garden exists not *out there* in some past geographical location, but within each and everyone of us. And though the Bible narrative tells us we are forever expelled, I believe this is a test, and if we can overcome the fear of losing these meaningless labels, we can return to the Garden anytime and experience a state of pure Being. This is what being present is all about. The Power of Now is there for all of us to grasp, at will, if only with a little practice :)  And your point about children is spot on. I have two of my own and watching them grow and develop has really helped me understand some fundamentals. For instance, the illusion of time. My oldest is five and if I tell her to wait fifteen minutes, she just barely understands what that means. Every two minutes she asks me, Is it time yet?"" Time--or clock time, at least--is learned. Which means it doesn't ""exist"" in any meaningful way. Same with all these labels! My youngest pulls hair, hits, pinches, and laughs her little face off. She isn't concerned with ""right"" or ""wrong,"" she's simply testing out cause and effect.   &gt; We put this grid over nature, and then we label each square so that we can tell ourselves that we know something about it.  I still think there is a purpose and need for this. The problem arises when we forget that the grid isn't real, just a tool for navigating and manipulating Reality. They are useful but not necessary, and they certainly aren't rigid or concrete. Even so, there are patterns in the dance of matter and energy, of ever-shifting forms, and we have the ability to pick out these patterns, analyze and learn from them, and in this the human animal--however you define it--is unique.   On earth, anyway.

I'm 15 years old, I try to collect amiibo as best as I can, I'm not a NiB collector as I like to spend time with my little brother training (Note: Smash is the only game we play) them with my little brother up to level 50 and put them on our own amiibo tournaments. It's a hobby we both share. Sadly, because of Nintendo and it's attitude for Amiibo, I nor my brother are able to get amiibo we most want, Ike being one that my brothers want and Shulk the one I want (My dick friend bought a $30 Shulk from Amazon fully knowing that I wanted him and couldn't get him, he gloated about it for a week and is now gloating about his greninja). All the amiibo I have I bought with my own money (I used to work in a pizzaria shop because my father was good friends with the owner but they recently closed so I dont have a job anymore) I got extremely lucky with my unicorns (they were hidden behind some skylanders in Walmart), my parents are Mexican so they don't give a damn about my obsession with amiibo, heck they don't care about my hobbies, they also will NOT buy me anything that is video game related, I had to save up for everything(me and my sister together saved up for a Wii U). I was lucky with Captain Falcon, he was super cheap ($15) on Amazon and I bought him without my dad's permission. He got pissed but not too pissed. Either way, I just spent my last 60 dollars on wave 4 for me and my brother, didn't have enough for Charizard or Wario that was money I saved up for splatoon but both me and my brother wanted the new wave. Again, my chances of winning is slim but in the rare case you pick me, my brother would like the Ike and give the WFT to someone who really wants it. Again I really appreciate you for doing this giveaway, it always gives me a bit of hope in my heart.                                                    Thank you /u/Thehunterforwonder"

I saw the movie in a true IMAX experience at the Henry Ford in Michigan. I couldn't understand half the dialogue and it really bothered me. For example when TARS makes his first joke during launch. Some of the theater laughed and I thought I missed something. This happened a lot during loud portions of the movie. I bought the Bluray and on my sound bar I heard so much great dialogue. A lot of other people told me the same so  thought maybe my theater screwed up the sound levels somehow. Now I read your post.   Why would Nolan want me to see it in the theater, but not hear the dialogue?    "

Things like enabling a half baked double tap to wake feature or disabling encryption that provides no perceptually discernable performance gain are not interesting to me.

On my S3 it was necessary to root to get away from touchpiss but on the nexus 6 there's no reason to bother.  Its much more effort then its worth even if the mod devs can actually provide a marginally better experience.

1,Biggest question of the night: Where is Leon Sandcastle going?
1,"The same reason why people aren't overreacting to Mariota's 2 INTs. I guess teams think each QB's performances were all about the kind of system they were in.  We saw Foles run a similar system as Mariota/Oregon in the NFL and finish with only 2 INTs one season, but the next season his INT count was much higher. Teams know that if they run a spread system similar to what Mariota was in, they probably aren't going to see his insane TD-INT ratio because NFL defenses have rapidly evolved.  Now take a look at Winston. Teams know what to expect from him because he was in a true pro system, and he finished with 25 TDs to 18 INTs. Which means teams are probably expecting roughly the same kind of performance in his rookie NFL season. If he does have 25-18 again, that would put him in a very similar range as the rookie seasons of Luck, Wilson, and Dalton - all three of which led their teams to playoff appearances."

From your post, it sounds like you are thinking about this relationship as a potential permanent partnership rather than as something more casual/just for fun. The scary thing about that is that means you're a ways away from your goal in the relationship--a long-term commitment. If it doesn't feel like you're progressing toward that goal, that can make you question the relationship. Your relationship might seem stagnant right now. It sounds like the two of you have reached a point where you are very emotionally intimate, so that part of your relationship isn't developing much over time anymore. Because you're in an open-ended LDR, your relationship also isn't developing much physically or in terms of practical commitments (after I finish school, we'll move together to city X,"" etc.).  Do you think that is what the problem is, or am I way off base? (Be honest.)

She's passionate about her religion, but is battling the fact she enjoys the pain she causes.  That was what I have so far."

1,"I believe one prominent reason that horror movies tend to be bad"" is that it's difficult to get characters into the desired scary situations in a believable way.    I think horror, moreso than most other genres, is subject to more intense scrutiny in terms of the audiences willingness to suspend disbelief.  ""Cops wouldn't do that,"" ""I wouldn't do that,"" ""yeah going alone is a great idea,"" and other thoughts like these are common reactions to typical horror flicks because writers have to come up with ways of getting people into strange circumstances.    That, and the fact that they have a more easily achievable albeit ""cheap"" way of giving audiences the indented thrills. You can't get tears without some serious emotional connection to the story, but you can ""scare"" the shit out of someone at ANY time with fast cuts and loud noises.

I have $40k worth of student loan debt. But because I got a degree I have an entry level position making $62k annually. If you say that I should have not gone to college and instead become a garbage collector or an equally horrific job, I'd tell you to fuck off.  Some people don't need to go to college, but that division is based on intelligence and work ethic, not on income. And not everyone is able to work during college, myself included. "

1,"&gt; Your response to my point that Christianity has done good things as well as bad things was the point out bad things Christianity has done.  In other words, you just repeated the same argument again without addressing my criticism.  The fact that Christianity has done good as well as bad is of little relevance here. This particular law is an example of one of the bad things Christianity has done because it is a transparent attempt to make it as difficult as possible for a woman to exercise her right to bodily autonomy.   &gt; You suggest that Satanism is a sincere religion.  You might have a point here, though I doubt their very specific alleged belief that waiting periods are against their region for abortions is sincere.  I assure you the members are very sincere. The third tenet of The Satanic Temple is One's body is inviolable, subject to one's own will alone"". This is taken very seriously. When the state imposes completely unnecessary obstacles to obtaining a legal abortion for the sole purpose of discouraging the free exercise of that right, with no other basis than the personal beliefs of the Christian majority in the state, it is a gross violation of her religious belief of the inviolability of her bodily autonomy. The Satanic Temple is not a stunt, it is not a vehicle for shock value, it is not a mockery of religion like some other organizations are. It is a religion with principles that are held dear by its members.

I am on the side that it meant ""sensitive to that"", but I can understand how people could have read it as ""generally sensitive"". However, I see no way that it implies ""overly sensitive"" or it used the word sensitive to be dismissive.   &gt;In fact, let's make one change. &gt;Should the government regulate blocklists in order to prevent sensitive individuals from being offended?

I'd LOVE to get better at my neutral game with spot dodges or whatever needs to be done, but time doesn't work for me. At all.   I'll give you an example. Before Smash 4, I never shielded.

However, this now leads me to a shielding habit and I get grabbed a lot(I'm also not good at perfect shielding because that requires reaction time and I'm not very good at that). So now I have to learn to spot dodge correctly.   I already know about observing opponent habits but the problem is this: characters with options.

Maybe that's why we get excited when our team is in this mediocrity state where we have lots of assets as well as young promising players.

Not as good in tight spaces as Hazard or at close control dribbling as Neymar   But combine that with the fact that he's 80% (to pick an arbitrary figure) as good as them at those aspects of play (which is still better than the vast majority of players) and add in his freakish athletic ability and he can be just as if not much more effective, dangerous and useful when in good form.   As Di Maria has shown this year a more traditional, technical playmaker/forward is much less effective than a more athletic one when out of form. "

Just a deletion of the /b/ consonant sound.

It's pretty clear that artistic depictions of religious figures and events can completely override the actual source material. They probably had no idea fig trees weren't around at the time when they first started popping up in artwork over hundreds of years. Art is the reason everyone assumes hell is on fire, heaven is in the clouds, angels are people with white eagle wings, god has a long white beard, adam and eve ate an apple, etc. Sometimes common depictions just sort of get in the way of things. Actually a ton of history is skewed in people's heads because they only know of the stereotypical wrong depiction such as the first thanksgiving, Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets, vikings wearing horns on their helmets, etc. "

If your applying to be a nurse, so few nurses are men the probability of an all-female nursing staff at a nursing home or similar is very high.  Even with out any sexism at all, select 10 nurses at random odds are you will get 10 females.  Is it a teacher position?  Again so few early childhood educators are men that it's highly probable to get an all female staff.  You shouldn't take this job because of the pedo-hystiria, not the sexism of the admin.  Her comments in isolation are meaningless.  The simple fact of all female staff is not.  You don't get all female staffs outside of nursing and child care with out significant amounts of sexism.  The admin may not be the sexist bigot, it may be one of the employees that makes the work place hostile to men."

The reason I'm still there is they allow single-topic 'megathreads' which run for thousands of pages - e.g. the boardgame thread or the league of legends thread. Very few places offer that sort of continuous discussion about specific hobbies where you can actually get to know people and it's not *totally* overrun with teenagers.  Having said that you need to do a lot of curating and figuring out which bits you like. Some parts of it are (intentionally) very unfriendly.

On the other hand, Max and Jaidynn were absolute *sweethearts* as well!  I think if I included stuff outside the season, I'd throw my vote with Miss Fame. If I restricted myself to things only said on the season itself, it would be either Max (for building people up) or Jaidynn (for being forever friendly).  Katya also... but the only thing that makes me a *lil* bit hesitant with Katya is that she does tend to kiki with bitchiness and does sometimes come across a bit as Ginger Minj's background vocalist when she's being cunty."

1,"While it depends on the world you are playing, from what I understand in Golarion necromancy pulls souls out of Phrarasma's boneyard before they can be judged. When an undead dies, its soul is destroyed.  The problem is the lesser god Groetus who hangs out above the boneyard. When the last soul is judged, Groetus descends on the boneyard which starts the end times. Pharasma keeps away Groetus by feeding him the souls of atheists.   So every time you raise the dead you bring the world one step closer to a permanent end. That is why creating undead is evil.   In general resurrection spells bring the soul back to life and usually is treated as it wasn't the soul's time yet. A resurrected character's soul still goes to the boneyard when it dies.  There are such things as non-undead necromancy. Essentially necromancy spells that don't deal with creating undead deal with the forces of life and death. Stuff like blindness/deafness, bestow curse and disrupt undead are under necromancy. Usually necromancy involves negative energy as well and as long as you aren't using it to heal the undead I don't see a problem with it.  Edit: see [here for more info on why it is bad](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/2sryhe/if_you_were_a_necromancer_how_would_you_get_along/cnsaxl0)"

Cause people say stuff all the time without really knowing, and just repeating the same stuff over and over again.  Kind of like how people always say there are stress cards in Basic"", you must have had it so easy with that stress card"". When we NEVER had stress cards. Maybe they tried it out for a limited time, but beyond that, they don't even have stress cards. And yet all these retarded mouth-breathing, window-licking, and ass-kissing specialists who have been in for 5 + years still cling to that garbage like it makes their generation better. Same shit older generations say to newer generations through the history of the military.   I just want an answer to this question.

1,"That is because you went to a midnight prerelease. Those really bring out the stereotypes.  I've played competitive Magic for over a decade, and I've been in many, many different stores. Sometimes, all the stereotypes ring true. But the tournament scene tends to attract the more serious players, and I've found the tournament population is more representative of the wider population. I've played in Magic tournaments and then gone to a bar to watch a punk band play. I've been to giant house parties held ahead of major Magic tournaments and had everybody go to the tournament hungover as shit the next day. I've also discussed anime and video games over casual games of Magic. I've had all kinds of experiences.  I'm sorry you had a bad experience, but please don't use that one experience to judge the entirety of Magic players."

1,I wouldn't worry too much about it. The viewership will stop declining eventually. I remember about a year ago the yogscast was experiencing the same problem. Viewership was going down and many doomsayers kept on harping about how they're dead and that this will be the end of the yogscast.  But now the yogscast is getting better and better views.  Their viewership is going back up and things are looking pretty good for them.  I think the reason YouTube groups experience this is because people's tastes change over time.  Some people have watched RT since the start but you cant expect that these people will keep watching forever.  People will leave and new people will come.

1,"Now this was a recurring dream I had when I was. It usually happens about once a year, and for the life of me can't really explain why but I'll do my best.  I start out in what seems to be the Amazon, like the trees and rivers. But they are Islands similar to the floating ones in Avatar. (I was having these dreams before the films but they are the closest thing visually) .Except the river is very straight, canal like. I'm floating down it as it gets faster and faster. I'm joined but random people I can't recognise, but they are floating down with me. There is no visible floating device. The river is straight but the trees and vines turn around me. Soon this ride takes me off the edge into the longest drop I ever seen. Its an almost perfect circle down, I can see other straight rivers entering from the sides. I fall down, I keep falling for a while. Then fade I to black, when I wake up, I'm wet and I'm down a street. The but there is only 3 houses I see, I'm encapsulated in a box, the blue walls go all around with room to spare. I get out of the gutter and walk to the first house in front of me. I peer through the window. There is a family inside, all happy, like Christmas dinner time. But not, one of the older children turn to look at the window and they see me. She screams, the while family looks over and they start panicking. I get worried and jump back, looking around. There is a mirror just floating between the house. I stand in front of it and look. I can't describe what I see, but it brings me to tears instantly. I cry desperately to this mirror, sobbing into my limbs (sometimes hands, othertimes tentacles, once wood). I sit down on the curb outside these 3 houses still crying where the youngest child comes over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder. At this point, it feels like the camera ending as I can see the child resting the hand on the thing and I pan up into the darkness where I wake up.  I don't know why I have this dream, it happened once to twice a year for majority of my life, not had it for 2 years but it sticks with me still."

I like how holding you to YOUR OWN WORDS all of a sudden become pedantry"". I associate intellectual dishonesty with bad arguments.  &gt; You don't understand what ""associated"" means?  as·so·ci·ate, verb, 1. connect (someone or something) with something else in one's mind. I ASSOCIATE weakly failed passive aggressive attempts to discount an argument by discounting the arguer with an ad hominem fallacy  &gt; I associate a weak vocabulary with bad arguments.  Ah, again. That's yet ANOTHER example of ad hominem. ""This is a bad argument because you can't speak well."" The argument and the vocabulary are not related to each other. OOPS! I like how you denied using a logical fallacy, only to IMMEDIATELY use it again. Well done, you fucking dummy, you just succeeded in putting ""I don't actually know what the fuck I'm talking about"" in bold.  &gt; Why do you hate children so much?  Are you fucking kidding me with that? I ""hate"" children because I say cutting parts of their body off without permission or medical necessity is wrong? Wow. THAT's logical.  &gt; ... easier for boys to keep clean, or avoid infections?  Hey, have you heard of this new thing called soap? It's apparently amazing at keeping things clean. No need to amputate body parts anymore. It's great! Oh, and have you also heard of this other new thing called ""medicine""? Like, if you get sick, you can take something and get better! No need to amputate! Wow! Modern medicine rules! It's way better than bronze age medicine, which is what you're advocating.  &gt; peace of mind that comes with knowing they have the penis that women prefer?  Hmm. The penis version of Pascal's Wager. Way to go. I like how you're advocating cutting up someone's body without permission based on the hypothetical assumption that a hypothetical mate would hypothetically prefer it. Sure sounds like rock solid reasoning and not emotionally charged cultural bias. Oh wait, no it doesn't. That's a retarded fucking argument and you're an idiot for making it.  cosmetic surgeries are performed on infants every day.  &gt; Yeah, TO FIX FUCKING PROBLEMS. Mutations. Abnormalities. Broken bits. The foreskin is NOT any of those things. Unles, of course, you're so thurougly brainwashed by your culture that you can't think clearly for yourself.

1,"I think people eat more and less healthily when they smoke because lots of people time their toking very poorly. For example, people smoke in the evening, after dinner. Now you get the munchies, so you eat again. And because you're stoned, you're not likely to eat something healthy but instead have whatever is convenient(junk food).    I've alleviated this issue with myself by smoking while I cook dinner. I eat a relatively healthy meal right as the munchies kick in, and I am good for the rest of the night. If you time your smoking with your meals, I expect it will be less of a problem. And planning ahead to have healthy snacks around could also help. Have some fruit or something instead of doritos.      But you're right, it's still not a healthy thing to do every day. "

1,"If you're a police officer and you know that a young black man js statistically more likely to vomit a crime than a young white man is, you treat the two with different levels of suspicion. It's profiling, but that's a huge part of what law enforcement does.  If you constantly stop and frisk middle aged white men in business suits on their lunch break, you're not going to stop much crime. If you stop and frisk young black men walking around residential neighborhoods in the middle of the day dressed like thugs, you're more likely to get a possession charge, etc..  It's unpleasant, but it's no unreasonable."

Outside it's not so much an issue, you can easily stand so the smoke won't get near you. There are times when you don't notice someone lighting up or you have to walk by them (like on a sidewalk) to get where you're going and then you'll be screwed because it's either walk past them and potentially get a couple of breaths of smoke or just stop.   But in a car, even with the window open, or in the house next to the stove fan, will still cause issues. Plus the stuff (cigarettes) stinks like ass hole. Pipe tobacco and cigars I can understand as they have decent flavors and can even smell pleasant to those around. But I've never smelt cigarette smoke that didn't make me think of a fat ladies ass.

1,"&gt; Yes, but we have been discussing about whether or not bans on polygamy would pass rational basis review.  No you have been doing that. I don't think you can even begin discussing the notion of rational basis until you have a clear understanding of what marriage is. I don't even think it is the right way to think about the problem to begin with.  The only thing I have said on the matter is that I don't think the legislative difficulties imposed by polygamy are a big deal.  ---------------  &gt; Fortunately, the law is judged from the standard of a reasonable person.   And this is the belief of reasonable people.  &gt; Believing that a gay couple getting married damages the dignity of their marriages"" is a subjective rather than objective belief.   And believing that marriage grants any kind of dignity is also a subjective determination.  Reasonable gay people believe they are being denied dignity, and reasonable straight people believe that granting gay marriage damages their dignity.

1,"Hey hey, as a final year medical student I can confirm that shadowing isn't really something that is done here per se, but there are opportunities down the line to get involved in emergency medicine.  Depending on which medical school you apply to, they will offer a variety of placements, some of which will be in various areas including emergency. That being said, I fell in love with emergency med within the first few years of my degree, but as a medical student we're really good at falling for almost every different type of specialty. I can guarantee that you will change your mind at least 5 times within your first semester at uni. As Mick_kerr's comment, try and enjoy your moment; get involved in the placement you're in.   If you're also undertaking rural terms, they can provide a really good hands on approach to working in a rural ED, where bulk interesting patients present.   Medical schools can also offer elective terms in the later years where you might be able to arrange with a particular department in any state to take a term (approx 6-8 weeks) with them. This is normally only later on in the degrees (years 5-6 in undergrad or years 3-4 in postgrad)  tl;dr concentrate on getting in to med school, enjoy the ride and don't forget to party on the weekends.   Feel free to inbox me if you have any more Q's! "

1,"&gt; With every large title release there's no doubt that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, will have already purchased these games.  True. My point was that with so few games available currently - this is even *more* true and more of an issue.  &gt; The indie titles might be new to most because most people don't like indie games.  Or, you know, it could be because they don't have million dollar ad campaigns and aren't featured on blogs and websites on a weekly basis. Or the player simply doesn't care about or follow gaming blogs and news beyond whatever game their friend showed them.  Sure, there are people that don't like 'indie' games... Which I don't understand as a blanket statement since 'indie' is not a genre... but that doesn't mean *most* people don't like them. But yes, it's true that some people just want awesome 3d graphics that are gritty and real and guns and blood and anything but something that might be seen as 'cartoony' or 'for kids'.   &gt;The gaming population would be better off with higher quality titles that a lot of people already own as opposed to a shitload of crappy indie titles nobody even want to own.  First off, it's your *opinion* that higher production values equate to *higher quality* games. I strongly disagree, as AAA game design is largely redundant and uninspired. Secondly, you're assuming/projecting that these indie games are crappy and that *most people* don't like them.  Overall, I just simply disagree with you. Giving away a game that's been out for over a year - that everyone already knows about - that has already been purchased by the people who are actually interested - is simply not-enticing. Nor does it really help the developer in any meaningful way aside from getting that cut that Sony gives to developers/publishers of the games on the IGC.  Whereas, giving away a handful of indie games that are lesser known gives us an opportunity to discover something we didn't even know about that might actually pleasantly surprise us. When a game does appeal to people, this causes them to start telling their friends about this lesser-known title, garnering more interest... which could, very likely, result in a lot more actual purchases after their IGC month because the word-of-mouth recommendations are slowly spreading out to those never knew about it. This helps these struggling developers (and usually actually go to the developers themselves) far more than the AAA publishers.  "

1,"&gt; But the difference? Players in other sports aren't going on reddit and reading posts about themselves (if you want to use basketball players who are 18ish in the NBA).   Teams like TSM ban their players from reading reddit for a reason. If social media isn't helping you, if your fanbase is nonexistent, don't bother logging into twitter or facebook to view death threats and people calling you trash.   &gt;They have years and years of professional experience around them, trainers and players and coaches and all of these people that, should someone actually get down from what they're saying, there's an entire support staff around them. Sports psychologists and everything.  MOst LCS teams are already at this level though! LXGG, specifically, is on a team with Seraph, who had terrible nerve issues and issues facing the community. People still have the same tools to deal with these problems.   &gt;That player isn't in your living room hearing you say it. This player could be on reddit reading it.  Lol people in Philly chant EAGLES"" when the Phillies aren't doing good. Live crowd fans can be just as brutal as reddit.   &gt;You're making my point.  Not really. I'm pointing out that while people shouldn't say it, that it is going to happen and realistically, players need to learn how to deal with it. Without doing that, players are going to constantly cave to trolls and pressure.   And don't think that the community alone brings about this pressure, management can as well. Don't deceive yourself into LXGG not thinking this wouldn't happen. Don't believe some naive fairy-tale land where subjectively low skilled players like LXGG are entirely under the illusion that they are WX reincarnated and they will entirely change the meta of League as we know it.

1,"This featurette makes me optimistic. It looks like they're really trying to do the gradual build-up to dramatic collapse"" approach that really made the first Jurassic Park so special (and wasn't replicated well at all in number 2 or 3).  My main remaining concern though is that the dinosaurs have some level of physicality in their interactions with characters. The original did this great, through limited use of CGI and lots of practical effects. The up close interactions the characters had with the raptors (and other dinosaurs) were so believable. The focus in the trailers on the larger dinosaurs makes me very concerned about this.

1,"To be honest, the mere concept of a brand rules out the possibility of true creativity and innovation; brands seek to brand things, while designers create new silhouettes and work with creating new products from scratch instead of putting any name or logo on an existing one. That being said, I think the designers that really have changed the name of fashion forever are the old (and some new greats); Yves Saint Laurent, Gianni Versace, Hubert de Givenchy, Coco Chanel, Georgio Armani and Rick Owens."

Next morning, dropped $5k on a diamond, drove 800 kms in 7.5 hours to show up, kneeling, on her doorstep in the rain on a cold winter's night...  She said no.  ...............  Here's a cool dumb story. I was doing a Viking combat display for the National Maritime Museum in Sydney. Threw my shield at my opponent, who responded by reaching out and hitting my now exposed, unarmoured hand, and severed my left index finger. I was then taken into a nearby corporate lobby where I bled copiously over expensive Italian leather couches, then on to RPA hospital where I was the first sword related injury in over 100 years. Only part of the incident I remember is looking at where my finger was now hanging by a single tendon, seeing the bone and spurting blood, and saying,  That'll need stitches"".  My next clear memory is of sitting in the A+E waiting room oh the RPA with a bunch of other fully armed and armoured Vikings. Finger was surgically reattached and I retain about 90% functionality, but have a cool scar and a unique story.

1,"I have seen a lot of these chance me"" posts on SDN and I really don't think anyone can offer a definitive answer either way.  That being said, I have been where you are and have benefitted a great deal from the advice and perspectives of others who were there before me.  So based on my experience applying, doing a lot of reading about applying, and speaking with others, a few points come to mind for you.    Firstly, your experience is great.  A lot of applicants focus on research or clinical experience and you have both.  It sounds like you have this aspect of your application down.  You will have great stories for your app essays and be able to earnestly describe your interest in dentistry to interviewers.  Secondly, your GPA isn't amazing, but it also isn't bad.  It certainly won't disqualify you, given your experience.  I have heard anecdotally that schools prioritize GPA above experience.  Perhaps a great GPA can even outweigh a lack of experience because it shows that you can handle the academic rigor of dental school.    Which, brings me to my last point: On the other hand, since your GPA is not amazing, you need to show that you have mastered the basic science curriculum that is the foundation of what you will learn in dental school.  Unfortunately, your only option (other than taking more classes and raising your GPA) is to dominate the DAT.    Your DAT score needs to improve.    Some schools have a cutoff where they will not accept an applicant with scored in any section under 17.  Your chances are not great right now.  You might get interviews, you may even get in, but the standards for admission to dental school are against you.   But that's okay!!!  Because you can improve your chances. So don't rule yourself out, just do some serious soul searching, dig deep down and find the will to come back and dominate the DAT.  The fact that you rushed through the last section is indicative to me that you weren't prepared.  Ask yourself what this path and career means to you and if it means enough, then use your willpower to sacrifice and study hard.    Make a plan.  Remove all distractions and obligations. Take 6 weeks off and study every single day.  Grab some exercise and see a friend or SO now and again, but make it your life's mission to succeed on the DAT.    I believe that you want to become a dentist.  I believe that you will make the choices you need to get there.  I believe in you.   Now go get it!!! :)

Running stealth would add time to the lock on time, so an ESF with stealth would take the maximum amount of time to lock on to.

There are a lot of great games on there that are more than worth their price, I think to simply blame the developers is to ignore the larger issues that are going on here. Ouya has had its back against the wall from day one, it was thrown under the bus by the gaming press, and it lacked the capital backing that has allowed other more established companies to enter the marketplace.   Blaming the developers for the ouya failing is like blaming students for a school closing. There might be a legitimate argument, but you are overlooking an important point. "

Of course I can say that about a UN draft resolution despite the ambassador of Ukraine saying something completely unrelated in a completely unrelated context in a completely unrelated place months later. There's no connection, for reasons of causality alone.  That's why I don't like talking to people who bring up obscure UN documents - they're usually conspiracy nuts who can't understand how two things can be not connected because they don't understand the concept.  Oh, and in case you still didn't notice despite my mentioning it several times - I was talking about the UN draft text which you misrepresented as a UN resolution and not neo-Nazis in Ukraine.

1,"My partner researches MS blood rheology and genomics so credit to her for this info:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), in which lymphocytic infiltration causes destruction of myelin and axons. During the initial stages, inflammation is temporary and the myelin sheath is able to regenerate, resulting in transient episodes of neurological disability.   While the cause of MS is yet be established, there are proposed theories, which include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, microbiological infections, and immunological lack of tolerance, leading to the development of the chronic inflammatory features of MS.   Hypotheses on possible infections are supported by the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with increased risk of developing MS (Levin et al., 2003). Lang and colleagues (2002) proposed cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors (TCR) to DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) and DRB5*0101-restricted EBV peptide as the mechanism behind the increased risk. In addition to possible molecular mimicry, EBV infected B-cells have been found in the meninges and post-mortem brains of MS patients and not in other neurological inflammatory diseases (Serafini et al., 2007).   The pathological processes of MS encompass inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, oligodendrocyte depletion, astrocytosis, neuron and axon degeneration, which ultimately result in the formation of sclerotic plaque in the CNS (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).  Migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) is believed to initiate the disease process, though research attempts to identify whether the BBB is dysfunctional prior to immunocellular infiltration. Altered haemorheology, leading to ischemic injury of the cerebral microvasculature, has been proposed as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction (Ballabh, Braun, &amp; Nedergaard, 2004). The extravasation of the T lymphocytes is achieved through the interaction of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon γ (INF-γ) with endothelial adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 (Engelhardt, 2006). Th17 lymphocytes may then secrete IL-17, under macrophage mediated IL-23 control, which together with lymphocytic IL-22 disrupts the BBB, allowing T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). While the antigenic target not fully established, it is likely the MBP and the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Moreover, an autoimmune response against the αB crystalline chaperone proteins prevents physiological suppression of cerebral inflammation (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008) and autoantibodies against neurofascin-155 and neurofascin-186, which are important for cell migration and adhesion in the CNS, mediate axonal injury (Mathey et al., 2007).  The accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbate the immune response through the recruitment of naive microglia. Microglia are then activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bind to the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex, previously opsonised with Fc fragments of antibodies and complement molecules. Microglial phagocytosis of the myelin sheath occurs upon surface-bound TNFα signal transduction (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) accumulate in the CNS further contributing to myelin and axon damage (Ortiz et al., 2014). While action potentials may depolarise demyelinated axon regions, conduction of these impulses occurs at reduced speeds (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).  In progressive MS, demyelination coexists with diffuse neurodegeneration associated with the build-up of insoluble tau (Bartosik-Psujek &amp; Archelos, 2004). B lymphocyte infiltrates accumulate in the meninges, leading to intrathecal antibody production (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).    If you'd like any more information or any of the full citations, just let me know."

1,"I work in an emergency room, this is how things go down at my hospital:  Ambulance calls in saying they have this type of trauma (we will use a traumatic 3/4 amputation of the left arm in a roll over accident as an example). We get 5-10 minutes notice that the patient is coming. So we call everyone. Lab (who does the blood type &amp; screen), X-ray, trauma surgeon, etc.  Patient shows up and we're all waiting for him. If EMS crews didn't get an IV, we have to establish IV access. Either way, we still need to draw the blood for the lab to test to get a blood type. Do we wait for the results to come back? Hell no. This guy is literally bleeding all over the damn place or did so at the scene of the accident.  At this point, depending how bad the patients injury and blood loss is, we just start infusing the 2 units of universal donor blood that lab brought with them, along with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and normal saline.   5 min is a long time when you're bleeding to death.

I actually have huge respect for what you do and thank you for what you're able to do for those people in your care; some situations would require much more self-discipline than I have myself.  I am a Molecular Biology and Applied Maths double major, so I definitely am part of the STEM crowd, but I don't actually feel the way I was impersonating. The only opinion I have that is slightly STEM-circlejerky is that psychology isn't a science in the same way that physics or biology is. I personally admit that biology isn't as hardcore as physics, so it just kinda rubs me the wrong way when psych majors want to consider themselves hard scientists, yet when you compare the courses of study, psych is simply not as rigorous.  Yeah, that's probably a bigoted view I'm guilty of holding, but I'm proud of the work I put into my degrees and when someone suggests that they are my equal when they haven't put in as much work as I have, I get worked up.  Anyways, I hope my comments didn't bother you too much because they weren't  sincere! Keep fighting the good fight for those in your care, I'm sure you're a very positive influence in their lives!"

However, the report also states that the confirmed/verified assaults have stayed stable over the years (from 885 to 902).   Even if we assume that all alleged sexual assaults did indeed occur, the Daily Mail's figures are ~20 times over the official ones."

1,"I agree with this. I also think a lot of the perceived grittyness"" or mature situations from anime comes from the Western notion that most animated series are for kids. When in reality, plenty of anime is made for an adult audience (like NGE, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, etc.). This idea has somewhat changed over time, but in general anime and animated series in the West are viewed as for children, despite their target audiences. NGE in America was originally aired on a block made for kids, but was pulled before the third episode.

The murder example is just kind of a throwaway example of things that people consider to be objectively bad...Though murder is not defined in the Catholic church in the same way it is defined secularly; animals actually don't count that way, exactly... (Before everyone jumps on this, there are several reasons you shouldn't go around killing animals all willy nilly, Catholic and non-Catholic reasons. We're not pro-meat eaters and we're not pro-vegetarian.)  The cancer example isn't well thought out. You can replace it with vaccine cases if you prefer. I'm really just kind of loosely throwing out stuff here when I should be more rigorous. And for that I ought to apologize. I want to address more as your questions are very good, but I gotta run off! So, feel free to type at me and I will respond later.

1,"A couple other things you could consider: You can paint the cable hider to match the wall, which might help to hide it even more. You could also pick up a couple more for the rear speakers, and paint them as well. In addition, the Fluance front speakers are rear-ported, so you'll benefit by pulling them away from the wall about a foot, if you can manage it.  THX recommends 80hz crossover, so I use that. Depending on how low your speakers get, you might want to adjust it beyond that. With small front speakers and small rear speakers, 90hz sounds about right.  Set your sub to 0, and adjust it if something ever seems off."

1,"I only point out that this is america because what works in another country may not necessarily work here, not cause murica. If family leave affects both genders and men have it worse how can you use it as an example of female oppression?  My point is that rape isn't a gender issue and it isn't oppression either.  I've never had to see a gynecologist so I can't speak on how easy it is to get an appointment but I can't agine it being any more difficult than scheduling any other Dr appointment.  Roe vs wade may get challenges but its still the law of the land, healthcare in general is expensive so I don't see how that is oppression either. As far as birth control goes there's plenty of inexpensive options and really no excuse since the primary purpose of vaginal intercourse is reproduction, people who are unwilling or unable to raise a child should practice abstinence rather than expecting the rest of society to pay for their birth control so they can have all the sex they like without consequence. If you're having sex you take on the possibility of a pregnancy it's not an accident I don't understand why people want to relieve themselves of responsibility for their actions.  Maybe I'm not recalling correctly on the domestic violence thing I do recall clearly seeing that women are the purpotratirs more often than men and they also tend to use weapons like knives, so I'd say men get hurt worse than women do.  Well women are generally way more emotional than men are so PMS or not you never know how much of what they're saying is truth and how much is exaggeration and drama.  Mansplain is a word made up to silence opposing views when men try to have a say in gender discussions, within the feminist movement men are constantly marginalized and dismissed, because equality. I'm coming into a female dominated apace to offer a different point of view. See you can class men dismiss women because of their gender but that is bullshit women get just as much respect as men do bases on what they're saying. If a woman is spouting crap that is incorrect or irrational then of course shell be dismissed the same as any man doing the same.  I was talking historically in response to the notion that women couldn't so things men could, it worked both ways and it wasn't just women who were forced into certain roles but that never gets brought up because if it was the case for men and women then you can't use it as proof of women being oppressed in the past. If histrionic has gendered connotations I'm not aware of it.  What I've learned from your post - women are somehow oppressed in the first world yet you can't give a single example of it, what you have given is issues that both men and women deal with being appropriated as affecting women only or  affecting women worse and complaining because society is supporting women with free/cheap birth control and healthcare."

1,"I'll add some quick recommendations so I can send you into the world of snails:  * Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream - *light moisturizer, not enough as a standalone cream* * Mizon All in One Black Snail Repair Cream - *slightly more moisturizing than the Mizon All In One Cream, but still not enough* * COSRX Snail Essence - *Great essence to check out, 96% snail mucin filtrate* * COSRX Snail Cream - *~~Higher snail mucus percentage than Mizon's cream,~~ non-irritating for sensitive skin, overall better*  -- Overall, I think the COSRX Snail Cream would be a great place to start and would probably help the most with hyperpigmentation out of all the other snail creams out there. As for dull skin, I would try out some sort of exfoliation such as Mizon 8% AHA Serum, COSRX AHA Whitehead Power Liquid or Cure Aqua Gel. Vitamin C serums would probably also help with both hyperpigmentation and dull skin so that's definitely worth a look over."
1,"&gt; It doesn't work like that. If they would label her as enemy or have any negative thoughts about her (like even I don't like her make-up""), they would be knocked down.  Well, Cherish is screwed, petty teenager that she is. You've still got Gray Boy as being effectively immune, as well as probably Mannequin and maybe Night Hag - Mannequin doesn't actually need air so I'm not sure exactly what stripping away oxygen in his blood would do, and Night Hag isn't human. Siberian also may or may not be effected - I don't know what she does when Manton is sleeping, and I don't know if he would even be hit. King might be able to pass on the effect to a pawn - his power was able to do it with Gray Boy's loops, so it works on pretty abstract types of ""harm."" Crawler's thoughts would be more ""play with me!"" than any sort of ill will towards her, and Bonesaw's would be along the lines of ""you're so cool! I can't wait to look inside your head!"" but I don't know how abstract you want to get with what her power defines as ""ill will."" Given Gray Boy's effective immunity, it doesn't really matter.  &gt;Siberian can be decomposed, since her power protects only against physical things. And he doesn't need line of sight.  She's immune to non-physical stuff like distorted time and, more importantly, Tatsuya has to identify the design of something before he can decompose it. That would cost him a precious second or two and would let the Hack Jobs teleport in to flip his powers off. Teleportation is instant, so his senses and reaction times shouldn't be able to stop it before it shuts him down.  &gt;Well, it may work, though Berserker gains resistance even if something doesn't kill him. God Hand is like fusion between powers of Crawler and Grey Boy.  The loop resetting should reset whatever resistance he gains, if it's a physical thing, or someone could simply go after Illya.  &gt;No, she is not. Saber is fast enough to essentaily be a teleporter for them. And how she reacts to GB is arguable.  Yeah, she sort of is screwed once Avalon is over, because she has no way to take down all of the 9000. If they wanted to, the Gray Boys could simply surround her in time loops while Avalon is up and that would be that. The loops are impassible to anyone but Gray Boy, so Saber's luck or instincts won't help her to escape them if she's already surrounded.  &gt;Cherish rather wont be able to find him, since he is not human anymore and even if she could, he can just turn into spirit and run away.  The bodies of Servants seem to operate the same way the bodies of normal humans do, for the most part, end even if they don't work exactly the same, she can sense case 53s and other not-quite-humans as well. I don't see why she wouldn't be able to sense him. Turning into spirit and running away is a valid plan, but then she would just search him down again.  &gt; If there is any way, Mitsuru takes it. Also OP haven't specified, that it has to be a head-on fight.  He's not specified as getting any prep, and they start in the same city. Unless the 9000 don't know they're in a fight for some odd reason, the Cherishes can work to hunt him down or Shatterbird can simply destroy the city and take him out that way.  &gt;Alessi's stand doesn't have to him opponent, but his/her shadow to work. And even if Siberian may be able to ignore it, Gray Boy cannot, since he has no protection from abilities, that turn time backwards.  Personally, I would argue that Gray Boy's ability to reset to a specific point in his own timeline would protect him from age reversal just as well as it would from any other power, but even if we assume it doesn't there's no way Alessi is going to take out every member fast enough to stop one of them from retaliating, especially given that he can't take out the Siberians.  &gt; Here is Kojou's wiki. He has some hax abilities like Grey Boy-like regen (that also allows him to turn things/people backwards in time), spatial erasure, obliterating several hundreds of kilometers with lighting and shields, that can resist even reality warping.  Looking at those familiars, just from the wiki I'll agree they could probably win if he pulled them out. The big threat to him would be Gray Boy putting him in a loop before he could summon one, as the looping would keep him from completing his chant. If he starts with the right familiars already out or if he starts out of sight somewhere, he should win.  &gt; Well, they can fly. And rift is created upon being struck with SCC beams.  Do you know if they're made of exotic materials? Shatterbird's scream would cripple them if they had silicon-based computers.  &gt; Well, thread is who can solo S9, not who can stomp it 10/10.  That's true.

Completely different experience, much better. Being 1 week overdue I had to advocate for myself to avoid induction/unnecessary intervention. Ended up having a vbac with #2 and highly doubt it would have happened had I been induced. Good luck!! You are your own best advocate for the birth you desire. "

1,"Ok, but in a scenario between two rebuilding franchises why don't we see a trade like this happen?  For example, the Cubs currently have ~3 SS in their system (Castro, Russell, and Baez).  The general consensus is that Baez will play 2B and Castro will eventually be traded so Russell can play SS.  However, the team doesn't have many pitching prospects so why not trade Baez for a top pitching prospect?  If anything, Baez has lost value since last year due to his extreme struggles at the MLB level (very high strikeout rate).  Trading him while he is still a prospect keeps his high value at the time and brings back another relevant future piece in return."

1,"Both are great lists and its very hard to say which is better. One thing to consider that I think many don't is the fatigue you face the longer a tournament goes on. Regionals will be 75 minute rounds and you will likely be playing 4-5 before they break to top 8. That's 5 to 6.25 hours of play at minimum if you don't drop. So anything that reduces the amount of mental exertion helps.

1,"But Pitt becoming famous is due to him having great looks. If he was ugly, then he would have been passed over for many of the roles he landed. Being pretty is a large reason actors land roles.   If they are horrible actors they are still going land jobs but not as many. Brad Pitt partially became famous for his role in legends of the fall and all the girls absolutely dawned over him and he landed a lot of roles because of women's reaction to him.  The Sex trade has been around longer the Christians have believed Jesus and the bible. This not going to change males are biologically programmed, with some exceptions, to be physically attracted to women at a very animalistic nature. Society as a whole has tried to change this few 100s of years but you can't get around it. Women wearing low tops, short short, yoga pants etc are playing on this primal male Sex drive. They are using it to their advantage to get ahead or gain something. Men use their own privledges to get ahead.   If some give a waitress a bigger tip based on their look that their issue.  Do I judge people? Ofcourse I do, but I realize that I'm judging someone and try to change my perception or reaction. You nor I have any right to complain or bitch about how someone else lives their lives. And if u do feel you have the right to do this then you should be okay when some interrupt your life or ability to make a living based solely based on their judgment of you.  Women are playing a game with men and it's one they choose to play by accepting these roles or jobs or lifestyle. You can disagree with this choices and live your life differently but by now means are you living a more worthy, or more important life then them. "

Note that the above advice is not necessary for people who are leveling their first combat class. You get some gear every five levels. But it's nice, especially if you can make high quality gear. Firstly, HQ gear has slightly higher stats. Secondly, it spiritbonds faster. When gear is 100% spiritbonded, you can convert it into materia, which is bought and sold actively on the market board, occasionally for ridiculous prices. I'd hazard a guess that once you begin converting gear from the lvl 30-45 range, you'll start getting the occasional gem that sells well.   You could also choose to level a class that gets most support from the gatherer class you're leveling. Miners provide most of the materials for armorers, blacksmiths and gold smiths, while botanists supply carpenters, alchemists, culinarians, weavers. A fisher is more fun for world exploration than supplying mats. When I was leveling crafters and had to buy materials from the market board, I hated it when I was forced to buy overpriced things, or stacks of 99. This is where self sufficiency in material gathering is a plus.   The most significant boost to crafting xp comes from tradecraft courier leves, where you usually pick up the leve in a hub city, then turn in the crafted item in another area. If you HQ the item you get double the xp. I believe you'll need to do about 10 of these to advance five levels, so stock up on material accordingly.

The most important things to do is keep your muscles strong, and STRETCH. If your residuum's hamstrings start getting contractures your gait will look like crap. Next, would be comfort of your socket and suspension. If it hurts to walk and you're always trying to avoid a certain area, it won't look normal. It also will look terrible if you keep slipping out the socket. The rest can be adjustable by a good prosthetist, and can be trained quite easily.  TL/DR; I thought you said AK; with your own knee, it's very easy to walk normally with no one ever knowing."

Shortly after sorting out the PS3 install, I registered the 1.0 codes for all my bonus goodies.  I'm on PS4 now but want to go PC before 3.0. If I get a suitable gaming rig, is there a way to get ARR on it without extra expense? I'll be buying the 3.0 CE soon and don't want to double-buy ARR if I don't have to.

1,"OSRS from what I hear is pretty god awful. They have a track record of being a bunch of childish pricks, there was an instance of a charity event being flooded with hate from OSRS in chat. That was a livesteam though, Twitch is kind of a cesspool anyway so that's a low blow on them though, I guess?  The PK community is mostly where OSRS went though, and we've seen how aggressive people can get over PVP.   Anyway, RS3's community's still pretty shitty too but that's mostly shown out of at least a genuine concern. The most annoying thing I see about the community is their stupidity regarding MTX. Being against MTX is totally fine but some people just are dense as shit and refuse to accept being even slightly wrong, then you've just got people who are way too zealous and refuse to want to work with Jagex and instead go for a very NO MTX WHAT SO EVER GET RID OF IT NOWWWWWWW"" sort of approach.   But even those people, they're not assholes really, even the people who really aren't level headed and really have no idea what they're talking about (which is by no means all of them) are really just looking out for what they believe is best for the game anyway. . .   So compare that to what I've said about OSRS . . .   Obviously RS3' got my vote.   _____  Being a skiller on RS3? Easier or harder . . . Mm. I guess harder, depends? OSRS doesn't have dungeoneering, dungeoneering requires you to either pay people to let you leech or for you to participate in combat so if we consider that? I guess RS3's way harder, especially with 120 dungeoneering.  Overall I tend to think of, content wise anyway, OSRS v. RS3 like this, RS3 intends to add more and more updates, OSRS will add very sparse, polled updates. RS3 is already years ahead of OSRS content by it's very nature. . . RS3's going to not necessarily be harder or easier as much as it will be more expansive.  We've got [runespan](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Runespan) for runecrafting and you can make some good money on [vis wax](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Vis_wax) so I guess maybe it'd be easier to do it on RS3? The main thing I'm really not sure about is prices for OSRS, this is a huge deal for buyable skills and largely will dictate just how hard things are. Tl;dr not really sure but I'd suggest RS3 anyway.  _____  Yes, skiller accounts are still a thing. Maybe less popular than before but they're still very much alive and kicking.

1,"I tried to withhold my judgment until the end.  I listened to the whole podcast over the Christmas break with SO and we had been told to listen to it by a friend who was hooked while it was still ongoing.  That friend laid out the evidence of a false conviction and was in the innocent camp when they recommended so I had that in the back of my mind - the whole - there is this serial killer that is the one that actually did it story.  By the end, I was scratching my head.  I thought there was some huge exculpatory piece of evidence coming and I never heard it.  From how SK and Rabia described the prosecution and CG, I expected something much, much more than what was presented. Still, I was pretty sure he was actually guilty but the case was weak.  I was particularly interested in the cell data as I worked in RF and cell planning for many years.  After looking at the actual maps and reading the actual testimony, it is clear that the prosecution did not claim what Serial or the innocent camp said that they claims (being consistent with is not saying is it 100% proof the call was from LP).  Once I read the testimony, I concluded that everything AW testified to was correct.  After reading over the actual transcripts, I am firmly in the guilty camp.  I don't think it was a moment of passion, I think it was premeditated murder over Adnan's pride being hurt.  I think he is a complete liar and lacks and remorse for the crime so he deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail.  I actually feel bad for the people in the innocent camp at this point as they are blind to the manipulation.  I can see the 'fresh from listening' crew still thinking innocent (or not enough to convict), but it is hard to fathom how anyone that has read the transcripts or read this sub for month or longer could still think that."

I've never broken ranks before, I've never had to, after Getty's mess, we had Klein, who was willing to do what needed to be done and weather the outrage.  But we don't have another Klein right now, just people who put ambition over responsibility.   I don't actually want any other party in power, but the PC's have to remember to represent us, not themselves. They're completely off the rails and need to be scared back on track. In Alberta, and in Ottawa too.   The WR would just be co-opted and ultimately strengthen the PC's, the Alberta party might as well not exist as it gets no traction in the shadow of the pc/wr's (too bad, because they're actually fairly reasonable), I'd wipe my ass with a ballot before I'd ever vote for the thieving Liberals, so that leaves me with the NDP, which makes me nervous, they have a history of ravaging provinces and are generally ridiculous.   But we DO need to play chicken with the PC's or they will never change.   This is a situation of driving home the point that a home needs to be renovated by tossing a moltov in the living room.

1,"&gt;but i hesitate to call it hate"" since ""hate"" implies malice (to me).    Past examples through history of what is called ""hate"", specifically to ethnic or religious minorities, have not relied on active malice. It is determined more by actions and attitudes inevitably based on treating these groups unequally.  Limiting it to active malice would let someone who supported Jim Crow laws out of callous indifference off the hook. The is a certain type of person out there who will treat these groups like that and not even consider them human enough to warrant a strong emotional response.  I also don't think anything is gained from holding back from identifying hate for what it is.

Generally when something has a really bad ending, you give it a score lower than you usually give it (had it ended better).  Even after the show ended poorly, he was considering giving it an 8.  Yes I guess you can be distracted about fancy art and what not. But the last thing that sticks in your mind is the ending. To give something an 8 and then have a completely thought process that manages to bring down your score in half is really odd, *especially* after the poor ending.   It makes me think that he was likely over analyzing/nitpicking.  I know not everyone uses the MAL scale, but 4 is most obviously a bad score (on a scale of 10)."

I feel confident that at least in this country free speech is safe, There are originations, like the ACLU, committed to upholding it. I don't think either the ACLU or my extremely conservative Con Law teacher would say the PoE incident has anything, whatsoever to do with free speech. In fact the only one telling someone thay can't say something is you. I say, you can say whatever you want. You are the one saying you can't say what you think, because language? It is a bizarre and indefensible understanding of free speech.  And since I just went appeal to authority that was at the 3rd best law school in California. "

The real trick is knowing what to make of all the info received I.e. how to analyze and what it means. It's not really that hard actually, just can be a lot of material to figure out.  The most important part of the DD process,  and this is just my opinion, will be the phase after these intial questions,  the follow up questions.  Baaically after finding out some things,  knowing what to ask next to probe further is crucial, to determine if and how much risk there really is.  Finally, I should probably say from experience depending on the size of the transaction a lot of sellers will baulk at such a rigorous list of questions as above.  Which you cant really blame them if for example its a $10k deal, the time spent to get that all together wouldn't be worth it.  Anyone interested in some more basic DD on websites ans startups to see some actual examples, you can see at a site of mine www.digisect.com. I haven't posted in a long time as I've been too busy but some of the posts are DD reports on actual websites that have been for sale and startup investments. "

The base area of the skill also appears to be larger than current lvl 1 RoA on live servers. There's also some changes to Inc. AoE (+20% inc at lvl 1) gem, and to Conc Eff gem (40% more dmg, 25% LESS aoe) These things combined, I'd say it's a very nice buff.

1,"RP is also a dialect, albeit a prestige dialect. Also, not even the queen speaks Queen's English.  &gt; Like all accents, RP has changed with time. For example, sound recordings and films from the first half of the 20th century demonstrate that it was usual for speakers of RP to pronounce the /æ/ sound, as in land, with a vowel close to [ɛ], so that land would sound similar to a present-day pronunciation of lend. RP is sometimes known as the Queen's English, but recordings show that even Queen Elizabeth II has changed her pronunciation over the past 50 years, no longer using an [ɛ]-like vowel in words like land."

1,"I'm saying that racism isn't a function of police unions, and it seems unlikely that if they went away cops would just wholesale stop killing black people. For example, Robert Bates was a reserve sheriff deputy in Oklahoma who shot Eric Harris in the back. Bates wasn't a member of the union, he was a volunteer and a donor to the department.  The issue also isn't cops not getting fired, it's a pervasive attitude within the criminal justice system. Prosecutors do not need the union's permission to investigate criminal complaints against police. The failed indictments in New York and Ferguson last fall had nothing to do with unions. Police abuse of power is criminal, they should be going to jail not getting fired."

1,"Oh man. I worked at a place over the summer that was generally *hell*. In the almost 90 days that I worked there, 18 people were fired or quit, including the one guy that got thrown in jail. some of them didn't work there for longer than a week. the guy that was hired the day before me didn't last beyond lunch break.  This was for a variety of reasons: Scheduling was always a bit fucky; we were almost always behind schedule. A couple of times my friend and I stayed there working until 8 PM (after starting at 6 AM and supposing to get out at 3 PM) just so we didn't fall ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY behind (which really just meant our manager would have been breathing down our neck until things got fixed and threats of firing us). Things broke all the time, the shop was always 50% new guys which meant hardly anyone knew what was going on, drama all the time, the company was undergoing acquisition from a larger corporation, the actual work was demanding physical labor...  But the general manager brought donuts in for us nearly every time we had to work on Saturday. We worked a lot of Saturdays. He even brought in a bunch of food and grilled lunch for us one day. He was a great guy, he was just a pretty bad manager. But the donuts made those Saturdays a little less shitty."

1,"Everytime he plays Bjergsen? In Bjergsen's first NA LCS finals, he destroyed Bjergsen. Hai died like three times total in that final. The second finals, Bjersen did better overall but Hai did great with his Zed too. In regular series, he has always done just fine against Bjergsen except in this split where Bjergsen was clearly better because well he is a better player but he also got way more resources in mid than Hai did.  Dade season 4? Hai never died 1v1 but yes Dade won that matchup but thats like saying Bjergsen got destroyed by POE so he sucks. It happens. As for Xpeke in S3, again Hai did just fine in lane but Xpeke took over late game with his Kassadin. As Hai admitted, C9 made a huge mistake because they thought they could counter Kassadin despite it being a super strong champion that everyone was banning. That said, in that series, Hai was actually the one that mechanically outplayed Xpeke and got a 1v1 kill with his Fizz.  Hai is not weak mechanically, its how C9 plays. They just dont pressure mid and prefers to focus elsewhere because Hai used to be self sufficient. He would compensate for it by putting pressure all around the map at the expense of his lane. But now with most teams getting pretty good at vision game Hai cannot roam as effectively anymore, and with his team not adapting to pressure more in mid lane relative to how much pressure his opponents are getting, Hai has essentially been a sitting duck this split.  Anyways, just because some reddit guys like you says Hai sucks doesnt make it so. I would trust what pros like Shiphtur, Voyboy, and even Bjergsen says about Hai."

I flunked out so any treatment they could have provided can no longer do me any good.  It's okay though, I'm working my way to transfer to another university.    When I first got kicked out I was bitter at UCSD, feeling like they could have been more understanding and all that, but I've since gotten over those feelings. I realize that as administrators they just thought that I wasn't taking school seriously; it's not like they were out to get me for no reason.    Plus, I think it doesn't matter what university or college a person attends as long as they make the most of their experience there.  Being a 4.0 student at a lesser known university is better than being a 2.0 student at UCSD or some other prestigious university like Harvard; at least in my opinion.  Others might disagree and think that only the name of the school matters.    For my major especially I don't think it matters since I'm doing computer science, and it's one of those fields where if you can prove that you know what you're doing, employers will hire you.

The chances of your family disowning you for being a vegan is incredibly less likely than if you were gay. Being gay also isn't a choice. Being vegan is. Which means that I don't believe it's fair to give the comparison to coming out of the closet.    If you feel bad about the meat industry, then go vegan. Like I said, you *will* face criticism, humiliation, taunting, and so forth. But every social cause has had that issue. Women could've sat down and shut up whilst men ran the world, but feminism would never have gotten its reach. Women would've been stuck in the household unlikely to ever get a job beyond possibly that of a secretary position.    ~~Black Americans could've kept their lips shut and sat at the back of the bus, but they would've continued to be put down if they didn't speak up.~~    If you believe in something, truly believe in it, you need to stand up and fight for it. You don't need to tell everyone you're vegan at every possible interaction (I only bring it up when it's relevant), but to say you hate the system but not to fight against it is both hypocritical and cowardly.    And yeah, they're curious because it seems unusual. You're so used to eating meat. Why stop eating it and why now of all times? You've got to talk to them about it first to see if they'll be supportive or not. If they're not, then you can always go vegan or vegetarian when you have control over your own life. But they may actually be supportive of your decision if you talk to them about it."

She spontaneously called in for work that day (It was 5 am at the time) and sat in the parking lot of the birth center all day until 2pm when the boy was born. And of course she told me this, so it was in the back of my mind the entire time. (She wanted to come in and wait in the waiting room. No? I had no idea what was going to happen. Those sound proof doors are good but...things like the shower and stuff are on the other side. All I need would be for her to see me, run down the hall and engage.)  In addition, we had a video chat with my mother in law with this baby at the gender reveal baby shower, and she posted some stupid picture she found, on facebook for all her friends to see, before I even got home from the shower (not a picture of our cake or anything, since there weren't any pictures yet...). I looked at the time stamp, did the math and figured out she had done it immediately. I confronted her about it, she deleted it, and still didn't re-share the picture that I had posted. Damage was done anyway.  Yeah, neither of them are knowing we're in labor until the baby is born, and they are not getting pictures until I post them myself. Remember, if they do it once, they'll probably do it again."

1,"&gt; Tennessee accepts New York marriages as legitimate and the new york married couple has all the rights and privileges of a Tennessee marriage when in the state of Tennessee.  Yes, this is correct. That is the point that Roberts was attempting to make. So long as the New York marriage was legal at the time it was formalized in New York, Tennessee accepts it as legal when the couple moves to the state and affords the couple all the rights of marriage in Tennessee.  But Roberts asked why a gay couple (who were married New York) are treated differently from a straight couple (who were married New York) upon moving to Tennessee. Think of this hypothetical:  You are a Tennessee employer who is reviewing marriage licenses for the purpose of spousal health insurance. There is a new employee, Adam, who is married to Taylor. They recently moved from New York.  The marriage license is legitimate, so why should you treat it differently if Adam is married to Taylor Swift versus Taylor Lautner? By denying health insurance to Taylor Lautner, you are effectively retroactively applying Tennessee marriage laws to a New York couple. That is improper under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  &gt; This is why marriage sinks to the least common denominator.   Marriage has always flowed to the lowest common denominator. That is why Las Vegas became a mecca for quickie, drunk marriages. There is no requirements about waiting periods or blood tests or counseling.  It is also why Scalia and Roberts hinted that they could rule against Question 1 but rule in favor of Question. It would create an exception that swallows the rule.  &gt; If California were to institute a single party initiated no-fault divorce without residence requirements that ignored pre-nups, then every marriage across the country would now be subject to that free divorce.""   This forum shopping already occurs in divorce cases though. That is why there is a whole cottage industry dedicated to choice-of-law questions with respect the divorce. One real world example is Katie Holmes divorcing Tom Cruise:  &gt; When Katie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise, she made a strategic move by choosing to file in New York rather than California.  &gt; New York is a good state to file in for parents who are looking for sole legal custody of their child—as Holmes is, according to TMZ. California is more likely to offer shared custody. (However, filing for divorce could be bad for Cruise since he has been trying to avoid the high tax rates in the city.)  http://laist.com/2012/06/30/katie_holmes_tom_cruise.php  &gt; So this notion that there is any kind of guarantee that ones marital rights will be protected outside of the state is a legal fiction.   But it is a legal fiction that has been consistently applied to all straight couples getting married. Suddenly when gay couples could get married too, states dedicated to stop the uniform applicable of the legal fiction. Such an abrupt change in state behavior signals a discriminatory purpose to the courts. (It was the basis for ""Windsor"" where the federal government had accepted any and all state marriages, but suddenly changed this practice when same sex marriage started.)

1,"Posting for the sake of misinformation which is rampant here. How long are you supposed to wait until you should get tested I believe it's two weeks, but I'm nervous wondering if that's too early?"" First off let's address this, there a lot of different types of HIV tests. The first which detects HIV the earliest post exposure is an HIV RNA test. This test has a high false readings rates which is why its seldomly ever used. The second earliest is a 4th generation HIV test which are very accurate now and have around a 90% success rate at 2 weeks post exposure(I recommend this test to ease your mind due to its early test time and high success rate.) The most common are 3rd generation HIV tests which are nearly 100% accurate at 6 weeks post exposure. None of these numbers are at 100% for 2 reasons, one to address possible failures in the test itself and two to address people who seroconvert later than others. Everyone who isn't heavily immuno-compromised will be detectable at 8 weeks on a third generation test, but I still follow CDC recommendations of follow up testing at 3 months to further confirm earlier tests. Note that this follow up test does not mean you will be HIV positive at 3 months you most surely will not as this is just a safety measure to get rid of those pesky .0000001% chances of test failures(which are mainly just statistical backlash anyways.) TL;DR on testing etiquette: RNA test don't do it, 2nd generation do it at 2week post exposure, 3rd generation test at 6 weeks and always test again at 3 months. http://www.rnceus.com/fl2hiv/test2.html source for information above and keep in mind the gaps in stats are to incorporate people who have compromised immune systems such as people on chemo, late stages of cancer, and heavy drug users. The windows of testing are large to make sure that no one slips by due to any matter as it would be negligent to otherwise considering the severity of HIV.  Next on the list the risk: The average per risk of condomless sex from topping a male who is infected with HIV is .03%. Yes it really is that low, HIV's ability to infect is very low as it infects a very specific and hard to find cell that it has to just bump into aswell as considering that HIV is extremely fragile. The virus dies near instantly upon exposure to oxygen and the viral amount needed to infect is roughly 2 million units of HIV(to put this into perspective the highest HIV amount the largest mosquito can carry from feeding off an AIDS infected patient is roughly 1,000 units which is near a full ounce of HIV infected blood from the highest concentration naturally possible. You can begin to see why HIV has a low infection rate and this isn't even taking into consideration the effect that the mucous membrane plays in your urethra in preventing HIV from passing into your body. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS I feel like I have rambled enough. You chances of contracting HIV are very low just test at the above recommendations and test again at 3 months for guidelines sake and in the future take care of yourself, know the risks, be careful, and remember that sex is only a small part of your life that could ruin the rest of it.

Regarding the all-or-nothing Firespray situation, who says everything is handled by the pilot? Why can't more than one person help? Remember that this is a narrative game that easily handles semi-flexible time flow, so you don't need to rigorously adhere to deckplans or other matters that are not outright stated. Even if you insist on one crewmember controlling everything, who's to say that the rest of the party can't be backseat drivers? They can make their rolls to come up with suggestions to manage the comms, angle shields, and use other systems, leaving to pilot to only have to input their requests and then focus on their own actions. The pilot should be literally limited to one maneuver and one action, but rather can only himself complete that many tasks; there's nothing saying he can't be doing other things in a round like inputing the actions of the rest of the party. If you still can't get it working, maybe it's time for a new ship so that everyone can participate.  Every single character should have a role to play and viable actions to perform in a physical conflict, and starship combat should be no different."

1,"Could you please show me where in the TORAH this is taught? Teshuva is outlined multiple times, and it involves atonement for sin. For example, see Leviticus 5:5-6, Leviticus 5:15-16, Leviticus 6:4-6.  Teshuva is turning back to YHWH, making restitution to remove the guilt, and then offering sacrifice to atone for the sin.  Lev 17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.""  &gt; It is THE BLOOD that maketh an atonement.  You can make restitution with your fellow man, and repay what you owe, or have transgressed in, but this does not bring atonement. Recompensation covers the GUILT of your offense against your FELLOW MAN. Atonement covers the CONDEMNATION unto death that YHWH has judged you with. You must be forgiven on both accounts. Recompensation is not teshuva. You must also be forgiven by YHWH himself.  Could you show me where in the Torah atonement is made without a life being given for your own? Sin brings death. When you sin, you are worthy of death, and blood must be shed, this is a Torah principle, and it is immutable. How do you gain atonement without temple sacrifice? If you cannot prove your position from the TORAH, then it is invalid. Isaiah 8:20 says:  ""To the torah and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word it is because there is NO LIGHT IN THEM.""

1,The Witcher series is a very very lore based game.   The Witcher 3 is going to have plenty of cutscenes and a ton of dialogue/choices to make.    So the Witcher 2 didnt even come close to 80 or even 10% of just cutscenes.   I suppose if you rushed through it and did nothing but main story quests you would tend to spend more time in them or if you consider dialog cutscenes?   If anything I would bet Witcher 3 is going to have way more cutscenes than previous titles.  However in a 50hr straight playthrough its probably still only a few hours at most total.   Just trying to be honest and say it doesn't sound like your type of game.  Chances are it will win several GOTY awards especially in the RPG categories.   So its going to be an amazing game but that doesn't have to mean its your type of game.

Almost no lies are truly flat on the course, and of course don't forget about rough and hazards. Certainly not least, is short game/approach.

1,"&gt;There has been a donation system, it's been largely a joke.  Well, because it hasn't been done exactly right.   Selling Skyrim mods (per installation) is a thoroughly bad idea. A lot of mods depend on other mods. So, either mods that are used in other mods would have to be free and copylefted (so their creators get nothing) or there should be a whole system in the workshop that tracks mod dependencies and makes you buy/install all required mods. But all of that would require extensive curation which Valve did not want to do.  Without a system to track all of this, payment model that Valve chose is simply incompatible with how mods are actually made currently, and it would be impossible to make that system make sense. "

Make an actual non-profit IT licensing body in each state, or nationally, and have them come up with standardized licenses. A better solution for employers so they know exactly what they're getting in a candidate, and a better solution for candidates so they're not paying a bunch of money to 2-3 certification companies every year.

1,"My blood pressure is definitely higher than baseline... my pulse is always at least slightly elevated.  No doubt.  I've been taking siladenifil but am planning on getting tadalafil as it's got a longer half-life.  As far as whether it's worth it... I'd say it all depends on how cheap you can get it, and what your significant other/children situation is.  IIRC the TD trestolone base I used was priced at ~$80 for 3g TD solution, so $26/1g.  It'd be real nice to get some bulk powder, and make your own TD solution, if you can get it cheap enough... I talked a source down to $36 a gram shipped and that's nowhere near where it needs to be, to be cost-effective.  Compare that to the popular source of pre-prepared trestolone acetate in GSO, which I believe sells at $36/1g on sale, $50/1g not on sale.  GSO compared to TD comes out to be about even if you figure the TD solution is absorbing at 50% at best, which is the unsupported-in-data impression I have.  And I was always worried about not getting it on my girlfriend, and washing up before bed.  That was the worst part about the TD stuff for me, by far."

1,"I am still using them. I switched over to some Cobra 1960kv motors. I am using BLHeli 13.1 and performance is great. No sync issues whatsoever. If you use the Afro or Turnigy tool it talks to the Simonk bootloader. If you go to flash it and it asks you what bootloader to use make sure to use Simonk (or have it leave the bootloader alone).  I also flashed BLH on some ZTW Spider 30a that I am using to run some 2600kv Sunnysky motors on 4s. Works perfectly even at those RPMS, though I found that using medium-high timing instead of medium made it seem more responsive in the low end."

1,I'm not wrong about the science. A supposed 0.7 degree rise in temperature over a 150 year period as we come out of an ice age is nothing to worry about. Temperatures have been flat since 1998. There is no urgent crisis.   This is also a very telling statement:  &gt; I said I have a lower carbon footprint than others in the society I live in.  That implies that people in first world countries are morally allowed to have a bigger carbon footprint than those in third world countries. But you're also admitting that your carbon footprint is bigger than most other people in the rest of the world. So therefore you're actually part of the problem.

When you dump a ton of them into a beer, the result is usually pretty tart since all of the sugar turns to alcohol and you're left with a lot of acidity and tannins. To get anything close to as sweet as Wild Blue you'd really have to backsweeten the beer, which is easy if you can force carbonate but trickier if you have to bottle condition, since you'll probably need to use an unfermentable sweetener."

In interactions, it can be used to catch someone in a lie, to make an observant comment about their appearance, or to notice something happening in the background. In combat, it contributes to the Deflection and Reflex defenses and grants a bonus to Interrupt."" So it suggest it's responsible for spotting things...

1,"So, in Golarion there's this path of souls... or a river of souls... some large contiguous body of all of the dead souls from forever. And they lead to Pharasma's place in the multiverse. (The Boneyard? Something like that.) And she's... processing them? Look, this stuff is complicated, just bear with me.  So Pharasma has a line of souls going for a long damned time. Lots of dead people, apparently. And on the other end of the line is a thing. I dunno what it's called, but it's bad. It's a bad thing. Really, it's The Bad Thing. When The Bad Thing gets to the front of the line and into The Boneyard the universe ends. Or maybe all life as we know it is extinguished, or the Abyss crashed into the Astral Plane. I forget exactly, but it's bad for everyone. Like, multi-versally bad.  Okay, so Pharasma-souls-souls-souls-souls-The Bad Thing. So what? Well, raising the dead pulls a soul out of line. The more dead you raise, the more souls (or soul energy, or what have you) you pull out of line. Since the souls are pretty literally staving off the heat death of the Universe pulling them out of line is bad.  Creating undead makes everyone (in the truly universal sense of the word) that much closer to planar catastrophy, up to and possibly including having every molecule in your body exploding outwards simultaneously at the speed of light and the frogurt being cursed. That's bad. Like... hastening the end times is actually, objectively, evil. Capital Evil even. The gods themselves have so spoken.  In not-Golarion? The disrespect and desecration thing. Possibly because a god says so.  &gt;I'd like to focus more on the necromancy side of things...  &gt;Does anyone have any suggestions of cool things I can pull off without being cast out of society (again)?  Aside from energy drain? Not really. Necromancy is kind of a creepy school. Hope the first part of this was helpful at least."

1,"Ok, so your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 31.6. Normal weight is 18-25, overweight is 25 to 30, and obese is over 30.   I am going to assume for these calculations you are 25 years old. If you are lightly active around the house all day, then you burn about 2200 calories per day. If you limit those calories to 1700 per day (a 500 calorie deficit), then you will lose 1 lb per week. If you want to lose 2 lbs per week, you will need to cut back further to 1200 calories per day.  Of those 1700 calories, you will want to make sure that you get an adequate amount of protein and fat since they will make you feel more full than sugary carbohydrates.  Right now, you are eating a lot of rice and bread which is mostly carbohydrates, and the fruit you are eating (the dates and banana) are sugary compared to, for example, an apple or berries. You might want to steer away from this, but I understand if your food budget would not allow it. "
